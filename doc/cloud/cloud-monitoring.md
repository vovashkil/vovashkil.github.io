Cloud-based deployments can be complex.
Monitoring performance across an entire stack of applications and services can be time-consuming
and draining on internal resources.
This is where cloud monitoring solutions come in.
Cloud monitoring solutions assess data, application, and infrastructure behaviors for: performance,
resource allocation, network availability, compliance, and security risks and threats.
Cloud Monitoring is not just about automated tools; it includes the strategies, practices,
and processes that need to be in place for analyzing, tracking, and managing cloud-based
services and applications.
It also serves to provide actionable insights that can help improve availability and user
experience.
Cloud monitoring helps to: Accelerate the diagnosis and resolution of
performance incidents.
Control the cost of your monitoring infrastructure.
Mitigate the impact of abnormal situations with proactive notifications.
Get critical Kubernetes and container insights for dynamic microservice monitoring.
Troubleshoot your applications and infrastructure.
Cloud monitoring solutions are designed to give organizations visibility and control
over their entire cloud-based infrastructure.
They provide: Data in real-time with round the clock monitoring of virtual machines,
services, databases, and applications.
Multilayer visibility into application, user, and file access behavior across all cloud-based
applications and services.
Advanced reporting and auditing capabilities for ensuring regulatory standards are being
met.
Large-scale performance monitoring integrations across multicloud and hybrid cloud environments.
One way to categorize cloud monitoring tools solutions is to break them down into Infrastructure,
Database, and Application Performance monitoring.
Infrastructure monitoring tools help identify minor and large-scale hardware failures and
security gaps so that developers and administrators can take corrective action before problems
affect user experience.
Database monitoring tools help track processes, queries, and availability of services to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of database management systems.
Application Performance Monitoring, or APM, measures application availability and performance,
providing tools needed to troubleshoot issues in an application's environment.
APM solutions help improve user experience, meet application and user service level agreements
(SLAs), minimize downtime, and lower overall operational costs.
To get the most benefit from your cloud-based deployments, you can follow some standard
cloud monitoring best practices.
Leverage end-user experience monitoring solutions to capture the performance of an application
from the point of view of its end users.
These solutions monitor user journeys to track parameters such as application response time
and frequency of use under varied conditions.
These insights will help you to improve customer experience significantly.
Consider moving all aspects of your infrastructure, whether in private, public or hybrid clouds,
under one unified monitoring platform.
This can help you to manage all your KPIs in one place with complete visibility into
performance optimization.
Use monitoring tools that can help you track the usage and cost of your cloud resources
and services.
Increase cloud monitoring automation.
This can help you gain significant operational efficiencies.
Simulate outages and breach scenarios to evaluate how well your monitoring tools capture and
alert against failures.
Cloud monitoring needs to be a priority for organizations looking to leverage the benefits
of cloud technologies.
It will help you manage and optimize your cloud resources for cost and performance,
and create better customer experiences.
