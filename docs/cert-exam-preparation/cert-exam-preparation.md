Wrong answers:
* High potential for failed architecture.
* An issue that might negatively impact business but is something minor that does not require immediate attention.

* Make a list of everything that could be wrong with the proposed architecture.

##### What is the definition of the reliability pillar?
* The ability of a workload to perform its required function correctly and consistently over an expected period of time.

Wrong answers:
* Reliability has specific patterns and best practices to adopt to meet sustainability goals, anti-patterns to avoid, and terminology to help communicate with others. The pillar will also help identify targets to reduce impact and identify organizational structures necessary for long-term success.
* The optimal solution for a particular workload varies, and solutions often combine multiple approaches.
* Building and operating cost-efficient workloads helps achieve business outcomes at the lowest price point. It minimizes wasteful architecture rework and supports greater investment in new business opportunities or technology.

A key stakeholder emails to explain that the team is too busy to dedicate time for the review because they are working on a tight timeline before the launch. Which is the best response?
* Explain that it is better to understand potential issues before the launch. Even though they may not be able to implement all changes before going live, it will help the team create an action plan for the future.

Wrong answers:
* Explain that a review should be done in advance to provide time to identify and address issues for a smooth launch. This review will identify any potential risks that may happen during launch. If there are too many identified, the team can opt to push back the launch date.
