# AWS Certification Exam Preparation
## AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Professional (SAP-C02)
### Domains
1. Design solutions for organizational complexity
2. Design for new solutions
3. Continuous improvement for existing solutions
4. Accelerate workload migration and modernization

### Well-Architected Framework
#### Operational Excellence Pillar
Operational excellence is the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into operations, and continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.

##### Operational excellence design principles
* Perform operations as code.
* Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
* Refine operations procedures frequently.
* Anticipate failure.
* Learn from all operational failures.

##### Operational excellence best practice areas
* Organization
* Prepare
* Operate
* Evolve

#### Security Pillar
The security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets on the cloud. To operate your workload securely, you must apply overarching best practices to every area of security. 

##### Security Design Principles
* Implement a strong identity foundation.
* Turn on traceability.
* Apply security at all layers.
* Automate security best practices.
* Protect data in transit and at rest.
* Keep people away from data.
* Prepare for security events.

##### Security best practice areas
* Security foundations
* Identity and access management
* Detection
* infrastructure protection
* Data protection
* Incident response
* Application security

#### Reliability Pillar
The ability of a workload to perform its required function correctly and consistently over an expected period of time. 

##### Reliability design principles
* Automatically recover from failure.
* Test recovery procedures.
* Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload ability.
* Stop guessing capacity.
* Manage change in automation.

##### Reliability best practice areas
* Foundations
* Workload architecture
* Change management
* Failure management

#### Performance efficiency
The performance efficiency pillar focuses on the efficient use of computing resources to meet requirements, and how to maintain efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

##### Performance efficiency design principles
* Democratize advanced technologies.
* Go global in minutes.
* Use serverless architectures.
* Experiment more often.
* Consider mechanical sympathy.

##### Performance efficiency best practices areas
* Selection
* Review
* Monitoring
* Trade-offs

##### Assessment
###### What are the areas of focus for performance efficiency pillar questions? (Select THREE.)
* Selecting the right resource types for compute, storage, database, and networking.
* Reviewing your selection as AWS continues to innovate with new resource types and features.
* Making architectural trade-offs to maximize your performance efficiency.

###### What is an example of a performance efficiency best practice in compute, storage, database, and networking?
* Select the appropriate resource type.

###### What is an example of a performance efficiency best practice in trade-offs?
* Position resources or cached dat closer to end users.

#### Cost optimization
A cost-optimized workload fully utilizes all resources, achieves an outcome at the lowest possible price point, and meets your functional requirements.

##### Cost optimization design principles
* Practice Cloud Financial Management.
* Adopt a consumption model.
* Measure overall efficiency.
* Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy-lifting.
* Analyze and attribute expenditure.

##### Cost Optimization Best Practice Areas
* Practice Cloud Financial Management.
* Expenditure and usage awareness.
* Cost-effective resources.
* Management of demand and supply resources.
* Optimization over time.

##### Assessment
###### Which is an area of focus for the cost optimization pillar?
* Use cost-efficient resources.

Wrong answers:
* Use serverless computing.
* Control and understand where your money is being spent by conducting regular testing.
* Use trade-offs.

###### Which is a cost optimization best practice in expenditure awareness?
* Use AWS Cost Explorer to categorize and track AWS costs.

Wrong answers:
* Manage access by creating user policies.
* Have a third party review the spend.
* Use spend manager to reduce data transfer costs.
