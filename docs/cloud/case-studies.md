In this video, we will look at some case
studies that demonstrate the use of
cloud computing in real business
scenarios, and the ensuing impact on
these businesses and the customers they
serve. The Weather Company's mission is
to map the atmosphere of the earth. And
based on that, generate the most accurate
and hyperlocal forecasts, which can be
served out to all our consumers and
devices - which number in millions across
the globe. Weather is unpredictable.
We need to be able to spin up and spin
down as fast as weather happens. Our
normal day-to-day load is 30 million
unique users. When we peak into
severe weather, that can go north of 100
million across our products. We
generate forecasts on demand. And our
forecast on demand system is responsible
for generating forecasts at a resolution
of one square kilometer grade. We deliver
forecasts on demand to the tune of 250
billion per day. On the backside of that
is our API platform. That system
operates at the scale about 150,000
requests per second. If our products
don't work, and don't work fast, people's
lives are in danger.
Imagine a hurricane is approaching the East
coast of the United States. As it is
approaching the coast, usage of my
weather data goes up tremendously. It can
go up from anywhere from two times, to
five times. It took us six months to
migrate to IBM Kubernetes from our
previous provider. What we've noticed
is some real efficiencies with DevOps.
It's reduced our workflow in pipeline
by about 80%. With the latest
hurricane, we were able to scale with IBM
cloud very easily, very seamlessly. IBM's
community service allows us to scale as
fast as the weather happens. As we
migrated our web platform to IBM
Cloud Kubernetes services, one of the
biggest advantages is that this is a
managed service... which allows our team
not to have to babysit our system;
enables them to do other work.
With the migration to IBM
Cloud Kubernetes, we've gained the
ability to have automation security
baked in. This was a feature in the
component that was very main for us in
the past.
IBM's security team proactively now
notifies us of any security
vulnerabilities. The tools and the
investment that the company's made, gives
us capabilities that we would have never
had before. It gets us very excited and
it gives our developers and engineers
opportunities to build new things that
they wouldn't have otherwise been able
to do. The global reach that IBM and IBM
Cloud together with our technology, with
our capabilities for forecasting, give us
the ability to extend our products and
services to keep people safe all over
the world.

[In-flight announcement: "Good afternoon ladies
and gentlemen. Welcome aboard. Captain speaking.
Anticipating on-time arrival.]
In the scenario where there's a flight
cancellation or some other off-scheduled
operation, we've had a system where we
find new seats and flights availability
for those customers. But I think
oftentimes customers didn't necessarily
know that that was the best option for
them. What we wanted to do was create a
system where they could actually see
alternate options. The goal was to
facilitate a better experience for our
customers on how to get to their
destination, in an automated fashion, on
the channel of their choice. In our
business, hurricanes, storms, are the
natural events that impact our customers
on a fairly regular basis. What happened - and
this is a true story -
the hurricanes hit and nobody said this
is ridiculous. Our customers were being
impacted by the hurricanes immediately.
Why are we mitigating risk of a
traditional rollout, when we have the
power of the Cloud? This is exactly
the scenario that our customers need
this capability for. I think people will now
realize that these kind of activities
and integration are much easier when we
can use cloud technology, and especially
microservices. We can break problems
into much smaller problems. Those get
much easier to wrap your head around and
develop. This is the technology that we
need to be adopting now in order to keep
pace with our customer expectations.
What I loved about my job at Cementos
Pacasmayo, is that it challenged
me every single day. Technology moves so
agile that I have to keep up with it.
What I love is that the company is also
on that same road; driving towards
it's digital transformations. Our
customers are now demanding quicker time
to market and also a more broad
portfolio of products. We need to keep up
and deliver the best service and
the best products that they can get, in
the least amount of time. We implemented
SAP S/4HANA on IBM Cloud since it
brings us a cost-effective
infrastructure. Also, it's quite
scalable. Cementos Pacasmayo is now
turning from a product-driven company, to
a service-driven company. The accounting
area now has real insights in real time
on our financial statements that they didn't
used to have. Also on our supply
chain area, especially on the procurement.
They now have the dashboard that helps
them make decisions right on time.

My name is Mukesh Sharma, and I'm the
Senior Manager of IT at Welch Food. Welch
started as an organization
150 years ago, and pretty fast
became the national. We are owned by the
farmers. It's a co-op. And we value the
sweat equity our farmers put into it. So,
that's what drives us every day; that our
farmers are working out on the farms.
And we were working here to make sure the
organization gets the best benefit of
each dollar spent back to them.
Welch's IT is the heart of the business -
all the manufacturing systems, any
manufacturing data which comes in
through different processing ERP systems,
you name it. We started this
journey with the private cloud. Then
at the same time, we have started the
process of asking ourselves on any new
application request, can it be run in the
public cloud? The approach we have taken
is to slowly and steadily start to move
these non mission-critical systems, which
can be done better by somebody else, let
them run outside. Let them spend time on
it, while we spend time on our core
values. Liquid Power is a company that
sells products that when you inject them
into crude oil or gasoline pipelines, it
changes the flow characteristics to such
a point that you can either: one, increase
the flow of those fluids, or secondly, use
less energy to actually push the fluids
down the pipeline. We needed to become a
standalone company under Berkshire
Hathaway, without any experience in
running our own infrastructure, or SAP.
We had to come up with the solution that
was best for our business to operate as
a standalone company. There were many
decisions we had to make. Do we go cloud?
Do we stay on-premise? How do we create
our own infrastructure and back office?
And what's the best decision for us not
only today and now, but in the future
going forward? So, I talked to some CIOs
and IT professionals. If you had a blank
sheet of paper, what would you do? Cloud
or go on-premise?
Without a doubt, all of them say
cloud. This whole process and the
migration to the cloud, is giving what we
believe is a competitive advantage. And
what I really love about having IBM with
SAP on the cloud, is it's scalable. We can
do it much faster, and change in a much
faster time period than we could
otherwise.
