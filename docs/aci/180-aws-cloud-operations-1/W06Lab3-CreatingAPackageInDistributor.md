Services used in this lab
AWS Systems Manager Overview
AWS Systems Manager is a powerful unified interface from AWS that provides you with the ability to centrally manage your AWS resources.

Distributor, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, helps you package and publish software to AWS Systems Manager managed nodes.

Task 1: Create custom package using Distributor
In this task, you create custom package which installs AWS CloudWatch agent using Distributor.

In a production environment you may want to consider using the Amazon owned AmazonCloudWatchAgent package. Amazon owned packages are maintained and updated by Amazon. The CloudWatch agent is used as a simple example to learn the process that can be used for any package.

Choose the following link and download the cloudwatch agent file to your computer: AWS Cloudwatch Agent

 Additional information: This will download the AWS CloudWatch agent RPM package for Amazon Linux on x86 64bit processors. An RPM file contains everything needed to install an application using the yum package manager on your instances.

At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose Systems Manager. This redirects you to the Amazon Systems Manager service page where you see detailed information about the service.

In the navigation pane, choose Distributor preceding Node Management section.

Choose Create package . This redirects you to the Create package page.

Configure the following options:

For title of the box, keep the Simple radio button selected

For details, in the Name box, enter: cloudwatchagent

For the location section, keep the Choose a bucket name from a list radio button selected.

In the S3 bucket name dropdown, choose the bucket name with cloudwatch from the dropdown menu.

 Note: This is the S3 bucket where you store the cloudwatch agent package.

For S3 key prefix, enter cloudwatchagent

In the Upload software section, choose Add software and upload the cloudwatch agent file you downloaded at the start of this task.

For Target platform, choose amazon from the dropdown list.

For Architecture, choose x86_64 from the dropdown list.

 Note: If you expand Scripts you can see that distributor has already provided the appropriate installation script. Observe that the install script uses the yum package manager with a reference to the file you just added.

 Note: If you expand Manifest you will see the mapping of target platform (amazon in this lab), platform version, and architecture (x86_64 in this lab) to the zip file you uploaded. If you had requirements to also install on an Ubuntu platform you would be able to upload a zip file for Ubuntu, and reference this file in a ubuntu key in the packages.

Choose Create package

 Expected output A pop up window appears and after a few minutes a success message saying that the upload is complete.

You are now re-directed to the cloudwatchagent package details page. Please wait until the Status of the package is changed to Active.
 Task complete: You have successfully created custom package for cloudwatch agent using Distributor.

Task 2: Install custom package using Run Command
Now that you have your custom package uploaded to your S3 bucket along with the manifest. Distributor gives you 2 quick options to deploy your package. You can either install on a schedule or install one time. Installing on a schedule automatically prepares a State Manager Association with the pre-defined Document of AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage and the name of your custom package as a parameter. Install one time does the same preparation but uses Run Command.

In this task, you install the cloudwatch agent package using the Install one time option which uses Run Command.

In the navigation pane, choose Distributor preceding Node Management section.

Choose Owned by me tab.

Select the radio button next to cloudwatchagent.

Choose Install one time . This will pre-populate the Run Command with all of the necessary configuration items to run against the instances you choose.

 Note: Run Command uses the Amazon Managed command document - AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage to run the package you created.

In the Target selection section, select Choose instances manually

 Note: In complex production environments with thousands of instances, the recommended approach would be to select targets by Specifying a tag. In this approach, you give the same tag name for each resource, and SSM systematically applies the configuration for every resource identified by that tag.

Select the two instances with name Test-Instance that will get the new Distributor package applied.

In the Output options section, clear the Enable an S3 bucket box.

Keep everything else as default and choose Run . You are now redirected to the to the Run Command progress for the distributor package deployment.

Choose Refresh  button, until the Command status section shows Overall status as Success.

Under Targets and Outputs section, select the radio button next to any instance ID.

Select View Output

In Step 2 - Command description and status section, expand the Output section.

Scroll to the bottom of the output log and you can see the successfully installed message as follows:

 Expected output


Installed:

amazon-cloudwatch-agent-1.300028.4b233-1.x86_64

Complete!

Successfully installed cloudwatchagent Auto-Generated-1700679952331
 Task complete: You have successfully configured a Distributor package with custom software, used Run Command to deploy the package to a Managed Instance.

Conclusion
You successfully done the following:

Created custom package using Distributor.
Installed custom package using Run Command.
