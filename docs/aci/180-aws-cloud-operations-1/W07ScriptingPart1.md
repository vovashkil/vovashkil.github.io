## Scripting

### Pre-assessment

#### Which task is a use case for scripting?

* Automating file backups

Wrong answers:

* Writing drivers for hardware components
* Developing high-performance video games
* Creating operating system kernels

Scripting is commonly used for automating tasks like file backups, system administration, and routine processes.

Using a device driver typically involves low-level programming, not scripting. Developing a high-performance video game or an operating system kernel are usually done with compiled languages.

#### Which scenario commonly uses Ruby?

* Web development

Wrong answers:

* Embedded systems programming
* Operating systems
* Scientific computing

Ruby is commonly used for web development tasks, thanks to frameworks like Ruby on Rails.

The remaining answers do not represent common use cases for Ruby.

#### What is a potential disadvantage of synchronous processing in the context of automating operational tasks?

* Scripts running longer

Wrong answers:

* Complex error-handling mechanisms
* Synchronous scripts are unable to port between platforms
* More complicated code

Synchronous processing in automating operational tasks can result in scripts running longer.

### Introduction to Scripting

Through the use of scripting languages, you can deploy resources, modify security settings, create user accounts, and more, all in an orderly fashion. Scripting brings a number of benefits to your organization, including 

* efficiency,
* standardization,
* and governance.

**Efficiency** is achieved through the automation of tasks like deploying large numbers of resources.

**Standardization** can be achieved through the use of infrastructure as code. By using a standardized deployment script, you can ensure that you’re getting the same resource with the same configuration every time.

Finally, scripting can help you with **governance**. The standardization and templatization that is capable through the use of infrastructure as code can help to ensure that your organization operates within the guidelines and regulations set by applicable governing bodies.

The term **scripting** is often used interchangeably with similar terms, like **programming and coding**. **Scripting** is, in essence, a **type of programming**. Both provide instructions to a computer, and both can use a variety of languages to achieve their intended outcome.

Programming is used to create a program. Generally, code is **compiled** prior to being run, and the compiled code runs in the same static way each time, unless it is recompiled. Put simply, compiling is the process of converting the language into machine code.

Scripting uses languages that **interpret** code to automate tasks and processes. Interpreting code means that instructions are active immediately, even if the code isn’t compiled yet. Languages like Java compile code, while Python interprets it.

### Advantages of using scripting

Scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks, enhancing efficiency, and streamlining workflows.
