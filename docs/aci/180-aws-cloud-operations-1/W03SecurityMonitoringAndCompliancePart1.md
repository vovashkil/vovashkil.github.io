## Compliance and Regulations

## Summary

### Regulations and compliance

### Regulations

A regulation is a rule created and maintained by an authority. Many companies have regulations that are specific to their industry, such as bio-pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and educational technology. The way that regulations are created and governed varies by region or country. 

### Compliance

Compliance is how organizations adhere to the legal requirements, laws, and guidelines that govern their business. The requirements an organization must follow might be because of any combination of the location of their business, the location of their customers, and the industry their business is in, such as the financial or health sectors.

**Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. This shared model can help relieve the customerâ€™s operational burden.**

### AWS compliance programs

With thousands of controls used to meet internal security requirements, AWS maps internal controls to the applicable compliance requirement. This approach to compliance can be adopted by AWS users. It is a useful starting point when considering local laws and regulations.

By using AWS, customers inherit comprehensive compliance controls to help them satisfy compliance requirements for many regulatory agencies around the globe. The IT standards AWS complies with are broken out by the following:

* Certifications and attestations
* Laws, regulations, and privacy
* Alignments and frameworks

### Vulnerabilities, threats, and weaknesses

These terms are often used interchangeably and incorrectly. It is important to understand how each of these terms should be used, what links them, and what sets them apart. The following is a way to differentiate them:

* A vulnerability is a weakness.
* A threat is a possibility for an event or act to exploit a vulnerability.
* A risk is the potential for loss, damage, or destruction of resources because of a threat.

### Standards and frameworks

With standards-based approach, organizations can benefit from the knowledge and experience of a wide range of industry best practices to secure their workloads. With the right frameworks, you can use these best practices and map security controls to your requirements. By implementing best practices through applicable frameworks, you can simplify meeting security requirements and ensure your organization is protecting the right resources with the right controls.
