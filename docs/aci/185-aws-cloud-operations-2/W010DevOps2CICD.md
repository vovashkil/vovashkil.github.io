## DevOps 2: Review of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

### Pre-assessment

#### What is the primary purpose of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)?

* It automates the software release lifecycle, which includes integration, testing, and delivery.

Wrong answers:

* It automates building and testing software code changes but requires manual deployment of infrastructure.
* Continuous integration builds, tests, and stages software code changes, and continuous delivery focuses on improving the development workflow.
* It reduces the amount of time to design and develop software code.

##### Explanation

CI/CD automates many of the deployment steps after a code change has been approved and merged into the main branch of a code repository.

The other options are incorrect because of the following reasons:

* CI/CD includes automating the building and deploying of the infrastructure for each environment.
* Continuous integration improves the development workflow through methods like the trunk-based approach. Continuous delivery builds, tests, and stages software code changes.
* CI/CD reduces the amount of time to build, test, and deploy software applications.
