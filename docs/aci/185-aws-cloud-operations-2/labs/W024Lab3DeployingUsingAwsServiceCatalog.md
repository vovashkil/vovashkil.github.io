# Deploying Standardized Assets Using AWS Service Catalog

## Lab overview

In this lab, you will create an AWS Service Catalog portfolio that contains four products. Each AWS Service Catalog product is backed by an AWS CloudFormation template, which is supplied as part of the lab. The first product is an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) environment for end user development purposes. The Amazon VPC is the destination for the other products that you will build. The second product is an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux instance. The third product is an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) MySQL database deployment. Lastly, you will build an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) product that is restricted by an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user and IP address range of your Amazon VPC.

You will also create and assign template and launch constraints for the AWS Service Catalog products that you create. You will set tags for the products and portfolio that you create, and assign IAM users to the newly created portfolio.

The lab includes two pre-assigned IAM users. The first IAM user is admin user. The admin user is assigned the role of an AWS Service Catalog admin (not an AWS admin), and has permission to create portfolios and products in AWS Service Catalog, but no direct access to other services. The second IAM user is developer user. The developer user mimics an end user experience and can only launch AWS Service Catalog products.

In a typical deployment scenario, the admin user is an automation or deployments team, or a business unit AWS admin who does not have control of the entire AWS environment. The developer user is a developer, business owner, or operations team member who is not concerned with the underlying AWS infrastructure and is more of a consumer of the final AWS services.

AWS services used in this lab
Amazon EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.

Amazon RDS
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archives, enterprise applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

AWS Service Catalog
AWS Service Catalog enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for AWS. These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, databases, and more to complete multi-tier application architectures. AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to centrally manage commonly deployed IT services, and helps organizations achieve consistent governance and meet compliance requirements. End users can quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need, following the constraints set by their organization.

Task 1: Create your portfolio
In this task, you will use the admin user credentials to create a new AWS Service Catalog portfolio. AWS Service Catalog portfolios contain products created by an AWS Service Catalog administrator. The portfolios provide a way to allow specific end users access to products with certain constraints determined by the admin. The admin user will only have access to create portfolios and products in the AWS Service Catalog, and they will have read-only access to AWS.

To log in as admin, you must log out as a normal lab user, and then log in using a special URL.

 Task complete: You successfully created Amazon VPC, Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and Amazon RDS products for your end users to use.

Task 3: Create launch constraints for your products
In this task, you will create launch constraints for your products. You need to assign an IAM role to each AWS Service Catalog product that allows AWS Service Catalog to create the products and their underlying services (Amazon VPC, Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and Amazon RDS) on behalf of the end user. These are referred to as launch constraints.

For the launch constraints, you will use four IAM roles that were built specifically for this lab: SC-VPC-ROLE, SC-EC2-ROLE, SC-RDS-ROLE, and SC-S3-ROLE. These IAM roles have their trusted entity set to the AWS Service Catalog service, which allows AWS Service Catalog to launch AWS services. This mechanism is used instead of granting direct access to AWS services to the end user (developer, in this lab), but still gives the end user the ability to launch the services in a defined, governed, and pre-approved way.

Task 3.1: Add a launch constraint for your Amazon VPC product
In the left navigation pane, under Administration, choose Portfolios.

Choose the My Portfolio link.

Choose the Constraints (0) tab.

 Task complete: You successfully launched the Amazon S3 product, which creates a bucket that only has access from your end user and to a specific IP range.

Task 8: Add template constraints
In this task, you will add template constraints. Template constraints help make AWS Service Catalog flexible in applying guardrails for end users. Limiting user access allows for higher security and fewer mistakes. A template constraint can be applied to any CloudFormation template input parameter, limiting its input values to either one value or a list of values.

In this example, you will limit the security group and subnet that can be selected for the Linux EC2 instance created earlier in this lab. You might have noticed that the end user can select any security group and subnet in the VPC. Once you configure the constraint, the developer user will not be able to select any security groups or subnets in the VPC, and they will be forced to select the single security group and subnet that you assigned in the template constraints.

To perform this update, log in as the admin user.

To sign out of the AWS Management Console, complete the following steps:
In the top-right of the window, choose the username user-developer @.
