* Organizational pressures
* Customer pressures
##### The supply chain professional plays multiple roles while interacting with the customer
* <b>Order taker</b>: The front-line staff that forms the interface between the external customer and the organization.
* <b>Advice giver</b>: The customer often looks for his or her valuable knowledge and advice as to what is particularly good or what is not worth purchasing.
* <b>Image maker</b>: As a service provider, he or she delivers the brand, especially in a B2B organization.
* <b>Service deliverer</b>: The customer-facing staff that may be the first and final point of contact for customers.
* <b>Problem solver</b>: Most often the most effective point of service recovery is at the point of delivery. Many informal problems and complaints are dealt with here.
* <b>Trainer and coach</b>: Customer-facing employees must be able to deal with both competent and less competent customers and sometimes inexperienced customers. Many customers need confidence building and coaching to ensure a good service experience.
### Knowledge Check
* <b>Focus group</b> discussion is a method for gathering customer objectives and expectations. The purpose of doing a focus group exercise is to organize information from the collective viewpoint of a group of customers that represents a segment. The customers who participate in this discussion are encouraged to brainstorm and come up with a clear statement of their needs.
* <b>Customer service objectives</b> - Successful businesses recognize the enormous impact that customer service quality has on their business. By understanding the links between employees, service, customer value, and profitability, businesses are able to plan where they and their team can contribute to service excellence and, ultimately, the success of their brand.
* SIPOC provides a structure where you can list the high-level process steps and identify the input and the output measures. <b>Both lead and lag indicators</b> are identified using SIPOC to scope the project, refine, and validate the problem and goal statements. By understanding voice of the customer and analyzing it using various tools, you can determine the proper direction for your improvement project.
* <b>Service profit chain</b> links employee capability and productivity to customer satisfaction and loyalty, which results into the profit and the growth of a business.
* <b>E-mail is not a viable way</b> to obtain information while conducting research using focus group discussion with customers.
### Topic Summary
* Good customer experience involves building a relationship by understanding what people want, need, and value. 
* The Voice of the Customer (VoC) represents a wide array of customer opinions, objectives, and expectations that help an organization listen to customer feedback and implement valuable change. The data collected from a well-structured VoC process can be analyzed and the outcomes can be used to improve the products or services offered by the organization.
* An organization’s customer service framework helps the organization recognize the importance of customer service as well as the essential contribution they can make towards their customers.
* Understanding the links between employees, service, customer value, and profitability helps businesses respond with excellent customer service, which contributes to the success of the organization. 
## Introduction: Eliciting Customer Requirements
### Gathering and Monitoring Requirements
#### Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) overview
A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a comprehensive tool that allows customer expectations to be recorded and maintained in one place. Not having an RTM heightens the risk of needs and requirements not being aligned in a structured manner. This also increases the risk that customer requirements are not included in software requirements. Understanding how to use an RTM and creating it at the onset of a project will move your software development activities in the right direction.

Some of the common elements that can be included in an RTM are: 
* <b>Customer requirements</b>: These are the customers stated expectations for the product. 
* <b>Business requirements</b>: These are an internal view of the products expectations and are typically linked to the organization's strategic and operational goals. 
* <b>Functional requirements</b>: These outline how the product, or a subset of the product must behave under certain conditions. 
* <b>Technical requirements</b>: These provide a granular view of the technical functionality of the product.
* <b>Testing requirements</b>: Test cases contain test requirements and describe how a requirement will be evaluated for efficacy and fitness for use. 

#### Steps for creating an RTM
* Inventory collection
* Descriptive details
* Visual organization
* Ongoing maintenance
#### Benefits of using an RTM in the requirement-gathering process
* Organization of customer requirements in a way that enables discussions with project stakeholders
* Establishing relationships between customer requirements and business objectives
* Mapping functional requirements with customer requirements
## Communicating with Customer to Solve Problems
### Key Communication Skills to Solve Customer Problems
#### Emotional intelligence
The ability to understand and manage your own emotions, as well as recognize and influence the emotions of those around you.

Emotional intelligence is simply acting in a thoughtful and self-aware way when interacting with customers. By using well thought out methods of determining and meeting customers’ needs and making customer service feel personal to the customers, companies can stay close to their customers and keep their business. Resolving problems and reviewing service transactions are also important, allowing continuous improvement of service delivery to take place.

#### Active listening
Active listening is a key communication skill that allows you to fully comprehend a customer’s message.
##### A few tips for reading vocal nonverbal cues are:
* A monotone voice often is an indication of boredom.
* Speaking slowly with a low pitch may indicate sadness.
* An emphatic, high-pitched tone is a sign of enthusiasm.
* An ascending tone may indicate astonishment.
* An abrupt tone may indicate defensiveness.
* A fast pace with a loud tone often indicates anger.
* Drawn-out speech with a high pitch may signal disbelief.
##### Three clusters of nonverbal cues:
* Yes gestures include a forward, lean, enhanced eye contact, and head nodding, which collectively suggest openness and positive feelings. 
* Maybe gestures include stroking the chin, head-scratching, and biting the tip of one's glasses, which typically imply uncertainty. 
* No gestures include increased fidgeting, constant eye movement, and folded arms, which together suggest defensiveness and negative feelings. 
##### Four major types of powerful questions; Objective, Reflective, Interpretive, and Decisional (ORID) questions.
* A fundamental objective question is simply, what happened?
* A fundamental reflective question is, what was your reaction to what happened?
* An excellent interpretive question is, how does this relate to other experiences that you have had?
* A powerful decisional question is, what would you do differently in the future based on this experience?
##### High-quality empathy
* "It's (then describe the sender's feelings) when (then describe the situation that is causing those feelings)."
* "You feel (then describe the sender's feelings) because (then describe the situation that is causing those feelings)."
* Example: "I get the sense that you feel uncomfortable asking for my help in this situation."
##### Elements of active listening
* Read nonverbal cues
* Inquire by asking powerful questions
* Empathize with customer's emotions
#### Silence and its uses
* <b>Remaining Silent</b>: For individuals who are comfortable with silence, remain silent after asking a question. Don’t answer the question for the other person or provide options to choose from. Allow the tension created by the silence to rise. 
* <b>Breaking the Silence</b>: When silence begins to feel like a test of wills, it is okay to break the silence. But don’t move on to a new topic. Instead, describe what just happened and ask a question about it. For example, say, “I asked you an important question, and you didn’t respond. I value your input and would like to hear your thoughts. What’s going on?”. The shift in the conversation from the topic of your question to the behavior of the silent person is very difficult for most people to resist, they feel the need to explain. Be prepared to be surprised by what the person says next.
* <b>Describing the Plan</b>: If the person still remains silent, describe your plan. For example, say, “I wanted to get your input before moving ahead, but I need to take action now. Here’s what I plan to do unless I hear differently from you.” If the person does not like your plan, this is usually enough to get them talking.
### Fundamentals of Customer Communication
#### Communication styles

### Measuring Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty
#### Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Analytics
* Customer surveys
* Complaints
* Repeat or lost business
* Ratings on social media
* Social media comments that are quantified based on sentiment
#### Characteristics of customer relationship analytics
* <b>Customer importance analytics</b>. The customer importance analytic rates customers on a scale of one to ten based on their importance and attractiveness to the company.
* <b>Customer relationship analytics</b>. The customer relationship analytic rates customers on a scale of one to ten based on the strength of the relationship. a) A high rating indicates that customers consistently give great reviews of the company's products on social media, recommend them to others, and have personal relationships with many staff members at local stores. b) A low rating indicates infrequent visits and purchases and an average or low level of satisfaction.
#### Customer interface analytics and customer aggravation
##### Optimize customer interface analytics
Customer interface analytics must track how much time it takes to find and purchase a product and the number of steps the customer has to go through to complete the purchase. Organizations should look for ways to optimize their customer interface analytics to maintain:
* The critical information that authenticates a customer’s identity.
* The history of purchased products and the time of purchase.
##### Measure customer aggravation
Measuring the daily level of frustration customers experience when interacting with organizations helps predict customer loyalty and proactively solve problems. One of the ways to measure this is by creating a customer aggravation analytics to help track how well it interfaces with customers. This analysis comprises many variables that relate to customer interactions and gauges their frustration level.
* It counts aggravations such as getting disconnected when placing an order or waiting in line.
* Then, each aggravation is multiplied by a severity factor of one to ten.
* Severity ratings are thus determined by using customer focus groups to rank frustrations from the worst, which is ranked a ten, to the most minor, which is ranked a one.
### Topic Summary
* Active listening, emotional intelligence, and silence are the key communication skills to solve customer problems.
* Fundamentals of communication form the basis of effective interaction and help improve communication skills. Some common communication styles are supportive, emotive, directive, and reflective. 
* In a customer-centric business, it is important to collect, analyze, and interpret data related to customer satisfaction to gain insights into how satisfied customers are with a product, service, or overall customer experience. 
## Defining success and communicating work value to customers.
### Communicating Work Value to Customers
### Leveraging Customer Insights
When done correctly, customer insight can transform new customers into loyal customers and loyal customers into brand advocates.

Developing a customer insight practice takes patience, investment, and a commitment to diving deep into big data to uncover the insights.
#### Companies can capture customer data from a wide variety of sources:
* Point-of-sale terminals
* Customer relationship management applications
* Mobile app usage data
* e-commerce and website usage statistics
* Social media streams
* Online surveys
* Customer support and complete databases
* Call center data
* Usability tests
* Customer returns and warranty requests
* Real-time product sensors
#### Big Data Analytics

Creating excellent customer and employee experiences means developing a deep understanding of your customers’ and employees’ needs, desires, frustrations, and challenges. 
#### Optimizing customer experience with customer journey maps
Customer journey maps visually represent a customer's experience of a product or service. They have two functions. 
* They enable you to design outstanding customer experiences.
* They help in identifying the touch points and moments of truth that cause problems and create bottlenecks in the customer's experience.
##### All customer journey maps share some common characteristics
* Define Customer Segments
* Set Goals: Business and Customers'
* Create Touchpoints: Frontstage (direct interaction) and Backstage (indirect interaction)
* Identify Moments of Truth
* Include Emotional Impacts
* Focus on Last Mile
#### Integrating Multiple Channels into a Seamless, Omnichannel Customer Experience
##### Utilize customer engagement for omni-channel approach
* Multi-channel approach: the organization views each channel as a distinct route to the customer with little to no coordination between channels
* Omni-channel approach: every channel must coordinate with every other channel
### Utilizing Communication Plan
#### Tools to draft a communication plan
* Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) chart
* Gantt chart
#### Drivers Needed for a Communication Plan
##### Communication planning must occur for internal and external dependencies
As soon as your team establishes its goals and activities, you should start organizing a communications plan. Identifying internal and external communication needs early will pay off by surfacing problems quickly, anticipating necessary communications, and using communication to gain acceptance and support for your endeavor.
#### Evaluation criteria for a communication plan
If the problem exists in the plan design, it should be corrected quickly, whether it is caused by an omission or a miscalculation.
##### Evaluating the success of your communication plan
* First determine any problems that might be caused by poor communication.
* Determine whether problems of timeliness, content, and delivery are inherent in the design or in the execution.
##### Problems of a Communication Plan
* Miscommunication or missing communication.
* A combination of communication issues and other causes and can be remedied using communication as a supporting tool.
* A problem that lies outside of communications and can only be addressed with other measures or interventions.

Sometimes your plan itself may be the cause of the problem rather than the execution of the plan. Denial of this fact will only lead to a repetition in the next design, while addressing the issue may uncover other problems of a similar type that are latent in later steps of the plan. Most problems arise because of omission rather than a lack of definition or specification.
##### The two most common and critical issues in the execution of a communication plan
* Timeliness
* Content

Both content and timing issues arise when previously undiscovered problems are not communicated. These usually take the form of taking too long to surface an issue due to fear of being at fault and an overly optimistic belief that the problem will go away. The result is often delayed communication and a worsening problem.
##### Another problem area for executing your communication plan
* Delivery method used

After determining that a given problem, in whole or in part, is one of communication, you must first analyze whether it lies in your original plan or in poor execution. If the problem exists in the plan design, it should be corrected quickly, whether it is caused by an omission or a miscalculation. If it is an error of execution, you should probe deeper into elements of timing, content, or delivery.
### Knowledge Check
* <b>The communication needs of all stakeholders</b>. When considering the missing elements in your plan design, the importance of your project sponsor, the size of your budget, the scope of the project, and the plan’s level of detail are not the correct context. You should consider missing elements in the context of the communication needs of all the stakeholders.
* <b>Determine the role of communication in the problem area</b>. Finding out quality control issues, the most responsible party, and preventability are not the first analysis to perform. You should first see if communication had a role in the problem.
* <b>Timeliness</b>. The most common and critical issue in communication plan execution is not the channel, cost, or technology, but timeliness.
* <b>Content</b>. When the sender incorrectly assumes some previous knowledge on the part of the recipient, it is not a problem of accountability, communication, or interpretation. Instead, it is a problem in the content of the message.
* <b>To avoid delays in the project</b>. The importance of paying attention to outside parties is not because they represent profit opportunities and can cause internal resentment or legal problems. They are, however, important to attend to because their actions can lead to project delays.
### Summary
* The primary goal of customer insight is to develop innovative products, services, and experiences that address the customer needs, desires, frustrations, and challenges.
* Ensuring there is a clear, established channel of communication between the customer and the various levels of the organization is critical in providing a holistic customer experience.
* A communication plan must include expertise in the form, style, and content requirements of the communication to enrich the customer experience. 
## Summary of Customer Comversation Module
* Describe the customer and understand the concept of VoC.
* Explain requirements elicitation and identify ways to monitor and track requirements.
* Describe key communication skills to solve customer problems.
* Explain how to create a value-centric culture and boost team motivation.
# Final Module Assessment
* An <b>Affinity diagram</b> can be used with single or multiple customers with multiple requirements, as it organizes data into related groups or themes.
* <Customer pressures</b> may result from trying to meet and exceed customer expectations, manage busy and intense customer contact, deal with customers who do not know all the processes, and deal with customers problems in difficult situations.
* The problem statement gives direction to your improvement initiative. Without a systematic validation of the problem, you are likely to proceed in a wrong direction and waste your efforts. Therefore, it is important that the <b>pain points</b> are clearly described in a project charter.
* Customer service generally comprises five components: corporate objectives, environment, service concept, performance objectives, and operations.
* Service characteristics are the elements that make up the service provided to customers and can be categorized into the following five elements: reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy, and responsiveness.
* The data and reports method uses existing information like market share, sales growth, product returns, competitor data, billing trends, collections history, and accounts receivable. It also includes secondary data available from preexisting market analyses of business trends and the opinions of industry experts.
* Knowing that functional requirements and technical requirements must be aligned, marking the intersection of functional and technical requirements is the quickest way to visually see the alignment. The intersection is marked with an "x".
* Empath occurs when you understand the emotions that the sender is experiencing and communicate your understanding of their experience accurately and without judgment.
* An innovative customer analytic developed by the cloud developer to measure customer aggravation should have <b>call center hang-ups and stockouts</b> as the key factors.
* Being <b>assertive, opinionated, determined, and formal</b> are what contribute to a direct communication.
* Companies can capture data from a wide range of sources, such as point-of-salr terminals, customer relashionship management applications, and real time product sensors.
