# Problem Solving
## Solving Business Problems
* Understand ambiguous problem statements.
* Perform a problem analysis.
* Define problems, interpret facts, and plan productive actions.

A business problem can be defined as any situation or challenge that creates an outcome that is different than the intended outcome for an organization.

A problem statement is a clear and concise description of a specific issue, challenge, or opportunity that needs to be addressed

### Understanding The Problem
#### Understanding ambiguity
Problem statements that lack clarity and precision give rise to ambiguity.

Though ambiguity may be unnerving, it's also energizing, resulting in experimentation, improvisation, and learning that often leads to innovative solutions. 

Ambiguity creates gray areas that can be tackled with practices, such as: 
* Mental modeling
* Scenario planning
* Design thinking
* Testing new ideas on a trial basis

Mental modeling and scenario planning help to create multiple solutions that anticipate different future situations. Design thinking enables developers to view problems from different stakeholder perspectives, and testing new ideas on a trial basis allows experimentation with and learning from different solutions. These practices, combined with effective communication, can lead to innovative solutions that meet user needs. 

In organizational settings, ambiguity tolerance is an employee's ability to handle uncertainty. Higher ambiguity tolerance results in faster action to explore alternatives rather than the paralysis or ad-hoc decision making often associated with uncertainty.

Ambiguous problems cannot be solved by conceptual analysis and planning alone, but also require experimentation, improvisation, and learning. 

### Problem Analysis
Analyzing a problem involves evaluating and interpreting information objectively and systematically. It helps in dealing with ambiguity by differentiating between facts, assumptions, and opinions.

The appreciative system is a framework for performing non-quantitative analysis that constructively challenges a course of action prior to performing a quantitative analysis that generates numbers.

The appreciative system comprises three interrelated components or judgments: reality judgments, value judgments, and action judgments. To make it even simpler, the system can be reduced to the questions "what?", "so what?", and "now what?".
* What's going on here? - REALITY
* What does this mean? - VALUE
* What should we do? - ACTION

The appreciative system can prevent closing issues prematurely, avoid groupthink, and expose unwarranted or unconsciously different assumptions, allow alternative points of view to be expressed, encourage periodic re-examination of actions and models, both mental and computer-based, document chains of assumption and inference, and provide an audit trail of your thinking, so stakeholders are more equitable judges of your performance. For the appreciative system to be truly effective, you must decompose and externalize a problem to help bring clarity to the situation and improve your decision-making.

### Defining a Problem
Reality. What's going om? What?

#### KPUU framework
* KNOWN
* PRESUMED
* UNKNOWN
* UNKNOWABLE

The KPUU framework nests beneath and expands on the reality judgments component of the appreciative system.

By creating a shared vision of what you know and what you don't, the KPUU framework stimulates useful insights and constructive debates to answer the question, "What's really going on?" During these debates, you can uncover new details or elements of a question, expose different people's assumptions, and possibly arrive at new solutions or at least identify crucial information to seek out.

Further, the framework provides an audit trail to demonstrate that the team members are thinking the problem through. It also helps uncover actions they can perform to give more clarity to the situation and, where possible, allow them to proactively minimize any potential negative effects. In short, it's a highly constructive way to map your ignorance about a situation and then start reducing it.

### Interpret Facts by Asking "What Does It Mean?"
Value. What does this mean? So what? - Reality judgments.

#### Two tools to help the team generate effective value judgments:
* Historical analogies
* Event cascades

##### Historical analogies
In fact, historical analogies are almost inevitable, and they can be very useful. At the same time, historical analogies can be misleading because the present and the future are never exactly like the past. So, what's the solution? Recognize the use of a historical analogy and make it explicit, write it down.

##### Event cascades
Event cascades link one event to another through a cause-and-effect relationship.

###### Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) Categories
To construct an explicit event cascade, place your company in the bullseye of a target with two outer rings. In the ring closest to the bull's eye, place - for example - the company's customers, competitors, and suppliers. These are the key players in the value chain that you need to consider. Then in the outer ring, add other entities in the value chain that could be impacted by the event and related production delays. This outer ring includes government regulators, industry associations, non-governmental organizations, and other third-party organizations relevant to the retail industry. 

Whenever intelligence analysts construct an event cascade, they make sure their categories are MECE. This means two things. First, when you structure your analysis, you ensure that your categories don't overlap, which is the mutually exclusive part. For example, customers, competitors, and suppliers are likely different companies.

Second, you must ensure that you don't miss any categories that are potentially relevant to your analysis, which is the collectively exhaustive part.

Cascade helps you examine the question, “what does this mean” more completely. It prevents gaps in your thinking, unwarranted assumptions, and blind spots about an event or considering only one possible cascade of events. By considering the impact of an event from many angles along with its possible end order effects, an event cascade greatly enhances your value judgments.

Using tools such as event cascades and historical analogies can help you challenge your own and other assumptions about the likely meaning and effects of key variables and events. These tools enable you to offer a rigorous and complete answer to the question "what does this mean?".

### Planning Productive Actions by Asking, "What Should We Do?"
Action. What should we do? Now what?

The powerful questions of the appreciative system, taken together, provide a more complete picture. They enable you to make more effective decisions and take action in a complex world.

#### Approaching the "What should we do?" question from two different angles
* What should we not do? - Produces an Not-To-Do List that may be useful under the pressure of later events.
* What could we learn that would make us change our minds? - Confirmation bias.

Studies show that people tend to notice what confirms their existing views and overlook what conflicts with their views. This is called confirmation bias, and everyone is prone to this bias. Studies also demonstrate that more information is required to change a plan after it's been formed than before it was made.

Analysis is usually a prelude to action and drives action judgments with the question What should we do?

### Summary
* Problem statements that lack clarity and precision give rise to ambiguity. Ambiguity can be managed with practices such as mental modeling, scenario planning, design thinking, and testing new ideas on a trial basis.
* Analyzing a problem is essential in problem solving, as it enables individuals to evaluate and interpret information objectively and systematically.
* Reality judgments are the observations you make when you assess a problem. They help define the problem by answering questions such as "what's going on?", or "what do we know?".
* Value judgments draw upon the past to propose future consequences. They use tools like historical analysis and event cascades to generate effective solutions.
* Action judgements are the decisions you make about what you should do as a result of everything you know.
