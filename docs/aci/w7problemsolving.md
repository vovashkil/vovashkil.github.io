# Problem Solving
## Solving Business Problems
* Understand ambiguous problem statements.
* Perform a problem analysis.
* Define problems, interpret facts, and plan productive actions.

A business problem can be defined as any situation or challenge that creates an outcome that is different than the intended outcome for an organization.

A problem statement is a clear and concise description of a specific issue, challenge, or opportunity that needs to be addressed

### Understanding The Problem
#### Understanding ambiguity
Problem statements that lack clarity and precision give rise to ambiguity.

Though ambiguity may be unnerving, it's also energizing, resulting in experimentation, improvisation, and learning that often leads to innovative solutions. 

Ambiguity creates gray areas that can be tackled with practices, such as: 
* Mental modeling
* Scenario planning
* Design thinking
* Testing new ideas on a trial basis

Mental modeling and scenario planning help to create multiple solutions that anticipate different future situations. Design thinking enables developers to view problems from different stakeholder perspectives, and testing new ideas on a trial basis allows experimentation with and learning from different solutions. These practices, combined with effective communication, can lead to innovative solutions that meet user needs. 

In organizational settings, ambiguity tolerance is an employee's ability to handle uncertainty. Higher ambiguity tolerance results in faster action to explore alternatives rather than the paralysis or ad-hoc decision making often associated with uncertainty.

Ambiguous problems cannot be solved by conceptual analysis and planning alone, but also require experimentation, improvisation, and learning. 

### Problem Analysis
Analyzing a problem involves evaluating and interpreting information objectively and systematically. It helps in dealing with ambiguity by differentiating between facts, assumptions, and opinions.

The appreciative system is a framework for performing non-quantitative analysis that constructively challenges a course of action prior to performing a quantitative analysis that generates numbers.

The appreciative system comprises three interrelated components or judgments: reality judgments, value judgments, and action judgments. To make it even simpler, the system can be reduced to the questions "what?", "so what?", and "now what?".
* What's going on here? - REALITY
* What does this mean? - VALUE
* What should we do? - ACTION

The appreciative system can prevent closing issues prematurely, avoid groupthink, and expose unwarranted or unconsciously different assumptions, allow alternative points of view to be expressed, encourage periodic re-examination of actions and models, both mental and computer-based, document chains of assumption and inference, and provide an audit trail of your thinking, so stakeholders are more equitable judges of your performance. For the appreciative system to be truly effective, you must decompose and externalize a problem to help bring clarity to the situation and improve your decision-making.

### Defining a Problem
Reality. What's going om? What?

#### KPUU framework
* KNOWN
* PRESUMED
* UNKNOWN
* UNKNOWABLE

The KPUU framework nests beneath and expands on the reality judgments component of the appreciative system.

By creating a shared vision of what you know and what you don't, the KPUU framework stimulates useful insights and constructive debates to answer the question, "What's really going on?" During these debates, you can uncover new details or elements of a question, expose different people's assumptions, and possibly arrive at new solutions or at least identify crucial information to seek out.

Further, the framework provides an audit trail to demonstrate that the team members are thinking the problem through. It also helps uncover actions they can perform to give more clarity to the situation and, where possible, allow them to proactively minimize any potential negative effects. In short, it's a highly constructive way to map your ignorance about a situation and then start reducing it.

### Interpret Facts by Asking "What Does It Mean?"
Value. What does this mean? So what? - Reality judgments.

#### Two tools to help the team generate effective value judgments:
* Historical analogies
* Event cascades

##### Historical analogies
In fact, historical analogies are almost inevitable, and they can be very useful. At the same time, historical analogies can be misleading because the present and the future are never exactly like the past. So, what's the solution? Recognize the use of a historical analogy and make it explicit, write it down.

##### Event cascades
Event cascades link one event to another through a cause-and-effect relationship.

###### Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) Categories
To construct an explicit event cascade, place your company in the bullseye of a target with two outer rings. In the ring closest to the bull's eye, place - for example - the company's customers, competitors, and suppliers. These are the key players in the value chain that you need to consider. Then in the outer ring, add other entities in the value chain that could be impacted by the event and related production delays. This outer ring includes government regulators, industry associations, non-governmental organizations, and other third-party organizations relevant to the retail industry. 

Whenever intelligence analysts construct an event cascade, they make sure their categories are MECE. This means two things. First, when you structure your analysis, you ensure that your categories don't overlap, which is the mutually exclusive part. For example, customers, competitors, and suppliers are likely different companies.

Second, you must ensure that you don't miss any categories that are potentially relevant to your analysis, which is the collectively exhaustive part.

Cascade helps you examine the question, “what does this mean” more completely. It prevents gaps in your thinking, unwarranted assumptions, and blind spots about an event or considering only one possible cascade of events. By considering the impact of an event from many angles along with its possible end order effects, an event cascade greatly enhances your value judgments.

Using tools such as event cascades and historical analogies can help you challenge your own and other assumptions about the likely meaning and effects of key variables and events. These tools enable you to offer a rigorous and complete answer to the question "what does this mean?".

### Planning Productive Actions by Asking, "What Should We Do?"
Action. What should we do? Now what?

The powerful questions of the appreciative system, taken together, provide a more complete picture. They enable you to make more effective decisions and take action in a complex world.

#### Approaching the "What should we do?" question from two different angles
* What should we not do? - Produces an Not-To-Do List that may be useful under the pressure of later events.
* What could we learn that would make us change our minds? - Confirmation bias.

Studies show that people tend to notice what confirms their existing views and overlook what conflicts with their views. This is called confirmation bias, and everyone is prone to this bias. Studies also demonstrate that more information is required to change a plan after it's been formed than before it was made.

Analysis is usually a prelude to action and drives action judgments with the question What should we do?

### Summary
* Problem statements that lack clarity and precision give rise to ambiguity. Ambiguity can be managed with practices such as mental modeling, scenario planning, design thinking, and testing new ideas on a trial basis.
* Analyzing a problem is essential in problem solving, as it enables individuals to evaluate and interpret information objectively and systematically.
* Reality judgments are the observations you make when you assess a problem. They help define the problem by answering questions such as "what's going on?", or "what do we know?".
* Value judgments draw upon the past to propose future consequences. They use tools like historical analysis and event cascades to generate effective solutions.
* Action judgements are the decisions you make about what you should do as a result of everything you know. 

## Understand The Root Cause Of A Problem
### Understanding RCA
#### Steps to perform an RCA:
* Define the problem and collect data
* Identify contributing factors
* Determine the root cause
* Implement solutions

RCA can also be used for systems analysis. Root Cause Analysis can be applied to pretty much any type of problem you encounter. The steps within Root Cause Analysis should be completed as quickly as possible, usually taking about two weeks. A typical analysis is completed within forty-five days of the event that initiates it.

Root Cause Analysis is such a useful tool that it's a greatly utilized part of several popular management techniques like Six Sigma, Kaizen, and Lean.

#### Step 1: Defining the problem and collecting data - state what went wrong, not how or why
##### Identifying events or problems to investigate using Root Cause Analysis from many sources:
* Incident reports 
* Risk management referrals
* Customer complaints 
* Internal complaints
* Ongoing performance analysis

##### Best practices for gathering a team
First, select people who can talk about the problem and examine it objectively, without bringing personal biases to their review. Sometimes, people who directly experience an event bring useful insights, but sometimes they can't, especially if they have strong emotions about the event. For example, someone whose actions caused an injury or accident may not be able to objectively participate. If they're not good candidates for the team, you should still get their insights through interviews.

Another best practice is to minimize the number of management level participants. Their presence can hinder some employees from providing information or from being completely candid in discussions about the problem. Finally, it's important that everyone involved in the process knows it's confidential. This understanding helps the people providing information about the problem feel safer when discussing breakdowns that may have caused a mistake or an accident.

##### Best practices for creating a formal problem statement
First, the statement or timeline should only describe the facts without any speculation about what caused these facts to happen. For an investigation of an event like an accident, the team focuses on the timeline of the event. It's important for everyone on the team to agree that the final statement or timeline represents the factual situation. The team should review the data they have for discrepancies and to ensure they include all critical information.

When you perform the RCA, you will use the timeline you identified to create the formal problem statement, so you must have accurate information. Finally, avoid jumping too quickly into trying to identify root causes. People may mention ideas on what they believe caused the event, but you should redirect their focus to fully defining the issue, making sure your team spends time mapping out the problem, so you don't miss any facts. Should the problem present a liability concern or questionable actions of an employee, then the team can recommend initiating a risk management or employee performance review.

In this first step, your problem statement should objectively state what went wrong, not how or why. 

#### Step 2: Identifying the contributing factors
Contributing factors are the circumstances, behaviors, omissions, or deficiencies that increase the risk of an event occurring.

##### some best practices for identifying contributing factors
First, whenever possible look at business processes as the basis for finding contributing factors. In the case of an incident investigation, you'd look to the sequence of events timeline. Go through each step, questioning all the surrounding circumstances at that stage. If the RCA is investigating a specific accident or event, interviews with eyewitnesses often provide details not included in official reports. In this case, information provided by workers carrying out the processes provides insight. Next, try brainstorming. It can be an effective tool for identifying possibilities. Ask the team for ideas about what factors they believe caused the event. Did employees fail to follow processes, skip procedures, or use informal workarounds? Did the warehouse have inadequate staffing or incorrect lead times? Finally, be aware of hindsight bias. Awareness of the outcome can affect the team's examination of circumstances and actions leading up to the event.

##### Tools to organize and dig through contributing factors
* An affinity diagram can help you organize facts, opinions, and issues into natural groups.
* A Fishbone or Ishikawa diagram represents the relationship between a problem or effect and its potential causes.
* The six M's represent standard major categories including manpower or personnel, machines, materials, methods, measurements, and Mother Nature, or the environment.
* The Five Whys technique is also very helpful in drilling down to the root cause, and it's often used within the fishbone diagram to investigate each cause. The five whys is a simple and effective technique that asks why enough times to get past the symptoms of a problem to see its root cause. The answer to the first why question becomes the basis for the next why question.

#### Step 3: Identifying the most probable root cause
When performing a Root Cause Analysis, the team must validate the root causes. There's still the possibility that a potential cause is just another contributing factor that needs more investigation. A good guideline to follow is to ask if the event would have happened if this cause wasn't present. Then, ask if the problem will happen again if this cause is eliminated or fixed. You should validate root causes with multiple data sources to ensure any corrective actions or improvement strategies align with the root cause. Consider these questions to help verify a root cause. "What is the proof that this cause exists? Is the proof concrete? Is it measurable data? Are there more than two data elements that provide evidence? What is the proof that this cause leads to the problematic effect? How do you know it wasn't actually something else? Is there anything needed in addition to this cause for the problematic effect to happen, or is the cause alone sufficient? Is there anything else besides this cause that can trigger the problematic effect? If so, do any of these alternative causes fit better?

The general understanding is that eighty percent of problems are produced by twenty percent of possible causes.

##### Graphing techniques to visualize data.
* A box and whisker plot. This graph helps you summarize data and define the distribution shape, as well as its central value and variability. This technique works well when you want to examine relationships among data sets from different sources in one graph.
* A pareto analysis. Use additive data such as costs or attribute counts. You cannot add data such as yields or percentages, so they're not appropriate for the pareto analysis. You also need to identify the time period for your data collection.

#### Step 4: Implementing solutions
The key to creating a successful solution is to implement specific actions that resolve each root cause by eliminating or preventing it. Your team should develop at least one corrective action per root cause. The actions you choose to implement typically mean you must update or develop new processes. Some parts of the solution may include fixes for contributing factors, but remember that if you address contributing factors without addressing root causes, you'll only create a temporary solution.

The most successful solutions rely on the strength of the corrective actions you take. To start identifying a solution, the team should consider these questions: "what precautions need to be taken to keep the root cause from recurring?" "How do we prevent the identified contributing factors from triggering the root cause?" "If the problem does happen again, how can we quickly catch and identify it?"

##### Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
It is used to identify all possible failures in a design, process, product, or service. FMEA is a way to ensure things get done the way you want them to. An FMEA starts by identifying the failure modes like the probable root causes Milton's team identified. A key element of FMEA is examining three characteristics for each of the root causes or failures, including how severe they are, how often they occur, and how likely it is that they will be noticed when they occur.

For each failure mode, you assign a rating of one to ten or one to five for each characteristic. These numbers are used to calculate a risk priority number or RPN for each failure mode. The RPN equals severity multiplied by frequency of occurrence multiplied by likelihood of detection. Let's look at an example. The FMEA Milton’s team produces indicates a severity number of six, a frequency of occurrence number of one, and a likelihood of detection number of one, which equals an RPN of six. In the overall ranking of RPN's, this failure mode is low. The idea is to focus improvement action on the failures that have the biggest impact, which are the highest scoring ones like low forecast accuracy. If the RPN is the same for any failure modes, you should prioritize by high severity, high occurrence, and low detection. You can use this baseline FMEA to compare to those you conduct later to assess improvement.

While devising the actions for a solution the team also needs to consider how to measure improvement or the success of the actions. The whole point of the Root Cause Analysis is to identify the causes that, if corrected, will minimize or eliminate the problematic event. What the team uses to measure success should answer these questions: "Were the corrective actions actually implemented?" "Are workers complying with the changes?" "Have the changes made a difference?"

### The Five Whys
The five whys technique is a straightforward and useful strategy to determine the root cause of a problem by successively asking the question “why?”.

The five why's uses the process of asking "why?" repeatedly to navigate through a problem to determine its root cause, ensuring solutions address the source. It's not about assigning blame, rather, the focus is on finding the right root cause to correct. 

When you are looking for an issues root cause, the five why's is a simple and effective technique for asking "why?" enough times to get past a problems symptom to uncover its root cause. The answer to the first "why?" question becomes the basis for the next why question. The five why's is frequently used to troubleshoot problems or address quality issues.

To get the best results from the five why's technique, form a team that includes those impacted by the problem symptoms. The team should clearly define the problem before asking "why?" and should continue to ask "why?" until it's confident the root cause has been identified. Only then should the team assess possible solutions.
