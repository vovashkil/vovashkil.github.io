# Problem Solving
## Solving Business Problems
* Understand ambiguous problem statements.
* Perform a problem analysis.
* Define problems, interpret facts, and plan productive actions.

A business problem can be defined as any situation or challenge that creates an outcome that is different than the intended outcome for an organization.

A problem statement is a clear and concise description of a specific issue, challenge, or opportunity that needs to be addressed

### Understanding The Problem
#### Understanding ambiguity
Problem statements that lack clarity and precision give rise to ambiguity.

Though ambiguity may be unnerving, it's also energizing, resulting in experimentation, improvisation, and learning that often leads to innovative solutions. 

Ambiguity creates gray areas that can be tackled with practices, such as: 
* Mental modeling
* Scenario planning
* Design thinking
* Testing new ideas on a trial basis

Mental modeling and scenario planning help to create multiple solutions that anticipate different future situations. Design thinking enables developers to view problems from different stakeholder perspectives, and testing new ideas on a trial basis allows experimentation with and learning from different solutions. These practices, combined with effective communication, can lead to innovative solutions that meet user needs. 

In organizational settings, ambiguity tolerance is an employee's ability to handle uncertainty. Higher ambiguity tolerance results in faster action to explore alternatives rather than the paralysis or ad-hoc decision making often associated with uncertainty.

Ambiguous problems cannot be solved by conceptual analysis and planning alone, but also require experimentation, improvisation, and learning. 

### Problem Analysis
Analyzing a problem involves evaluating and interpreting information objectively and systematically. It helps in dealing with ambiguity by differentiating between facts, assumptions, and opinions.

The appreciative system is a framework for performing non-quantitative analysis that constructively challenges a course of action prior to performing a quantitative analysis that generates numbers.

The appreciative system comprises three interrelated components or judgments: reality judgments, value judgments, and action judgments. To make it even simpler, the system can be reduced to the questions "what?", "so what?", and "now what?".
* What's going on here? - REALITY
* What does this mean? - VALUE
* What should we do? - ACTION

The appreciative system can prevent closing issues prematurely, avoid groupthink, and expose unwarranted or unconsciously different assumptions, allow alternative points of view to be expressed, encourage periodic re-examination of actions and models, both mental and computer-based, document chains of assumption and inference, and provide an audit trail of your thinking, so stakeholders are more equitable judges of your performance. For the appreciative system to be truly effective, you must decompose and externalize a problem to help bring clarity to the situation and improve your decision-making.

### Defining a Problem
Reality. What's going om? What?

#### KPUU framework
* KNOWN
* PRESUMED
* UNKNOWN
* UNKNOWABLE

The KPUU framework nests beneath and expands on the reality judgments component of the appreciative system.

By creating a shared vision of what you know and what you don't, the KPUU framework stimulates useful insights and constructive debates to answer the question, "What's really going on?" During these debates, you can uncover new details or elements of a question, expose different people's assumptions, and possibly arrive at new solutions or at least identify crucial information to seek out.

Further, the framework provides an audit trail to demonstrate that the team members are thinking the problem through. It also helps uncover actions they can perform to give more clarity to the situation and, where possible, allow them to proactively minimize any potential negative effects. In short, it's a highly constructive way to map your ignorance about a situation and then start reducing it.

### Interpret Facts by Asking "What Does It Mean?"
Value. What does this mean? So what? - Reality judgments.

#### Two tools to help the team generate effective value judgments:
* Historical analogies
* Event cascades

##### Historical analogies
In fact, historical analogies are almost inevitable, and they can be very useful. At the same time, historical analogies can be misleading because the present and the future are never exactly like the past. So, what's the solution? Recognize the use of a historical analogy and make it explicit, write it down.

##### Event cascades
Event cascades link one event to another through a cause-and-effect relationship.

###### Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) Categories
To construct an explicit event cascade, place your company in the bullseye of a target with two outer rings. In the ring closest to the bull's eye, place - for example - the company's customers, competitors, and suppliers. These are the key players in the value chain that you need to consider. Then in the outer ring, add other entities in the value chain that could be impacted by the event and related production delays. This outer ring includes government regulators, industry associations, non-governmental organizations, and other third-party organizations relevant to the retail industry. 

Whenever intelligence analysts construct an event cascade, they make sure their categories are MECE. This means two things. First, when you structure your analysis, you ensure that your categories don't overlap, which is the mutually exclusive part. For example, customers, competitors, and suppliers are likely different companies.

Second, you must ensure that you don't miss any categories that are potentially relevant to your analysis, which is the collectively exhaustive part.

Cascade helps you examine the question, “what does this mean” more completely. It prevents gaps in your thinking, unwarranted assumptions, and blind spots about an event or considering only one possible cascade of events. By considering the impact of an event from many angles along with its possible end order effects, an event cascade greatly enhances your value judgments.

Using tools such as event cascades and historical analogies can help you challenge your own and other assumptions about the likely meaning and effects of key variables and events. These tools enable you to offer a rigorous and complete answer to the question "what does this mean?".

### Planning Productive Actions by Asking, "What Should We Do?"
Action. What should we do? Now what?

The powerful questions of the appreciative system, taken together, provide a more complete picture. They enable you to make more effective decisions and take action in a complex world.

#### Approaching the "What should we do?" question from two different angles
* What should we not do? - Produces an Not-To-Do List that may be useful under the pressure of later events.
* What could we learn that would make us change our minds? - Confirmation bias.

Studies show that people tend to notice what confirms their existing views and overlook what conflicts with their views. This is called confirmation bias, and everyone is prone to this bias. Studies also demonstrate that more information is required to change a plan after it's been formed than before it was made.

Analysis is usually a prelude to action and drives action judgments with the question What should we do?

### Summary
* Problem statements that lack clarity and precision give rise to ambiguity. Ambiguity can be managed with practices such as mental modeling, scenario planning, design thinking, and testing new ideas on a trial basis.
* Analyzing a problem is essential in problem solving, as it enables individuals to evaluate and interpret information objectively and systematically.
* Reality judgments are the observations you make when you assess a problem. They help define the problem by answering questions such as "what's going on?", or "what do we know?".
* Value judgments draw upon the past to propose future consequences. They use tools like historical analysis and event cascades to generate effective solutions.
* Action judgements are the decisions you make about what you should do as a result of everything you know. 

## Understand The Root Cause Of A Problem
### Understanding RCA
#### Steps to perform an RCA:
* Define the problem and collect data
* Identify contributing factors
* Determine the root cause
* Implement solutions

RCA can also be used for systems analysis. Root Cause Analysis can be applied to pretty much any type of problem you encounter. The steps within Root Cause Analysis should be completed as quickly as possible, usually taking about two weeks. A typical analysis is completed within forty-five days of the event that initiates it.

Root Cause Analysis is such a useful tool that it's a greatly utilized part of several popular management techniques like Six Sigma, Kaizen, and Lean.

#### Step 1: Defining the problem and collecting data - state what went wrong, not how or why
##### Identifying events or problems to investigate using Root Cause Analysis from many sources:
* Incident reports 
* Risk management referrals
* Customer complaints 
* Internal complaints
* Ongoing performance analysis

##### Best practices for gathering a team
First, select people who can talk about the problem and examine it objectively, without bringing personal biases to their review. Sometimes, people who directly experience an event bring useful insights, but sometimes they can't, especially if they have strong emotions about the event. For example, someone whose actions caused an injury or accident may not be able to objectively participate. If they're not good candidates for the team, you should still get their insights through interviews.

Another best practice is to minimize the number of management level participants. Their presence can hinder some employees from providing information or from being completely candid in discussions about the problem. Finally, it's important that everyone involved in the process knows it's confidential. This understanding helps the people providing information about the problem feel safer when discussing breakdowns that may have caused a mistake or an accident.

##### Best practices for creating a formal problem statement
First, the statement or timeline should only describe the facts without any speculation about what caused these facts to happen. For an investigation of an event like an accident, the team focuses on the timeline of the event. It's important for everyone on the team to agree that the final statement or timeline represents the factual situation. The team should review the data they have for discrepancies and to ensure they include all critical information.

When you perform the RCA, you will use the timeline you identified to create the formal problem statement, so you must have accurate information. Finally, avoid jumping too quickly into trying to identify root causes. People may mention ideas on what they believe caused the event, but you should redirect their focus to fully defining the issue, making sure your team spends time mapping out the problem, so you don't miss any facts. Should the problem present a liability concern or questionable actions of an employee, then the team can recommend initiating a risk management or employee performance review.

In this first step, your problem statement should objectively state what went wrong, not how or why. 

#### Step 2: Identifying the contributing factors
Contributing factors are the circumstances, behaviors, omissions, or deficiencies that increase the risk of an event occurring.

##### some best practices for identifying contributing factors
First, whenever possible look at business processes as the basis for finding contributing factors. In the case of an incident investigation, you'd look to the sequence of events timeline. Go through each step, questioning all the surrounding circumstances at that stage. If the RCA is investigating a specific accident or event, interviews with eyewitnesses often provide details not included in official reports. In this case, information provided by workers carrying out the processes provides insight. Next, try brainstorming. It can be an effective tool for identifying possibilities. Ask the team for ideas about what factors they believe caused the event. Did employees fail to follow processes, skip procedures, or use informal workarounds? Did the warehouse have inadequate staffing or incorrect lead times? Finally, be aware of hindsight bias. Awareness of the outcome can affect the team's examination of circumstances and actions leading up to the event.

##### Tools to organize and dig through contributing factors
* An affinity diagram can help you organize facts, opinions, and issues into natural groups.
* A Fishbone or Ishikawa diagram represents the relationship between a problem or effect and its potential causes.
* The six M's represent standard major categories including manpower or personnel, machines, materials, methods, measurements, and Mother Nature, or the environment.
* The Five Whys technique is also very helpful in drilling down to the root cause, and it's often used within the fishbone diagram to investigate each cause. The five whys is a simple and effective technique that asks why enough times to get past the symptoms of a problem to see its root cause. The answer to the first why question becomes the basis for the next why question.

#### Step 3: Identifying the most probable root cause
When performing a Root Cause Analysis, the team must validate the root causes. There's still the possibility that a potential cause is just another contributing factor that needs more investigation. A good guideline to follow is to ask if the event would have happened if this cause wasn't present. Then, ask if the problem will happen again if this cause is eliminated or fixed. You should validate root causes with multiple data sources to ensure any corrective actions or improvement strategies align with the root cause. Consider these questions to help verify a root cause. "What is the proof that this cause exists? Is the proof concrete? Is it measurable data? Are there more than two data elements that provide evidence? What is the proof that this cause leads to the problematic effect? How do you know it wasn't actually something else? Is there anything needed in addition to this cause for the problematic effect to happen, or is the cause alone sufficient? Is there anything else besides this cause that can trigger the problematic effect? If so, do any of these alternative causes fit better?

The general understanding is that eighty percent of problems are produced by twenty percent of possible causes.

##### Graphing techniques to visualize data.
* A box and whisker plot. This graph helps you summarize data and define the distribution shape, as well as its central value and variability. This technique works well when you want to examine relationships among data sets from different sources in one graph.
* A pareto analysis. Use additive data such as costs or attribute counts. You cannot add data such as yields or percentages, so they're not appropriate for the pareto analysis. You also need to identify the time period for your data collection.

#### Step 4: Implementing solutions
The key to creating a successful solution is to implement specific actions that resolve each root cause by eliminating or preventing it. Your team should develop at least one corrective action per root cause. The actions you choose to implement typically mean you must update or develop new processes. Some parts of the solution may include fixes for contributing factors, but remember that if you address contributing factors without addressing root causes, you'll only create a temporary solution.

The most successful solutions rely on the strength of the corrective actions you take. To start identifying a solution, the team should consider these questions: "what precautions need to be taken to keep the root cause from recurring?" "How do we prevent the identified contributing factors from triggering the root cause?" "If the problem does happen again, how can we quickly catch and identify it?"

##### Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
It is used to identify all possible failures in a design, process, product, or service. FMEA is a way to ensure things get done the way you want them to. An FMEA starts by identifying the failure modes like the probable root causes Milton's team identified. A key element of FMEA is examining three characteristics for each of the root causes or failures, including how severe they are, how often they occur, and how likely it is that they will be noticed when they occur.

For each failure mode, you assign a rating of one to ten or one to five for each characteristic. These numbers are used to calculate a risk priority number or RPN for each failure mode. The RPN equals severity multiplied by frequency of occurrence multiplied by likelihood of detection. Let's look at an example. The FMEA Milton’s team produces indicates a severity number of six, a frequency of occurrence number of one, and a likelihood of detection number of one, which equals an RPN of six. In the overall ranking of RPN's, this failure mode is low. The idea is to focus improvement action on the failures that have the biggest impact, which are the highest scoring ones like low forecast accuracy. If the RPN is the same for any failure modes, you should prioritize by high severity, high occurrence, and low detection. You can use this baseline FMEA to compare to those you conduct later to assess improvement.

While devising the actions for a solution the team also needs to consider how to measure improvement or the success of the actions. The whole point of the Root Cause Analysis is to identify the causes that, if corrected, will minimize or eliminate the problematic event. What the team uses to measure success should answer these questions: "Were the corrective actions actually implemented?" "Are workers complying with the changes?" "Have the changes made a difference?"

### The Five Whys
The five whys technique is a straightforward and useful strategy to determine the root cause of a problem by successively asking the question “why?”.

The five why's uses the process of asking "why?" repeatedly to navigate through a problem to determine its root cause, ensuring solutions address the source. It's not about assigning blame, rather, the focus is on finding the right root cause to correct. 

When you are looking for an issues root cause, the five why's is a simple and effective technique for asking "why?" enough times to get past a problems symptom to uncover its root cause. The answer to the first "why?" question becomes the basis for the next why question. The five why's is frequently used to troubleshoot problems or address quality issues.

To get the best results from the five why's technique, form a team that includes those impacted by the problem symptoms. The team should clearly define the problem before asking "why?" and should continue to ask "why?" until it's confident the root cause has been identified. Only then should the team assess possible solutions.

## Generating Solutions And Decision-Making
* Creating a productive environment for decision-making.
* Generating appropriate solutions and manage conflict within a team using various strategies.
* Identifying appropriate decision making tools.

### Decision-Making Process
Decision-making is a structured process that involves steps to choose the best option from different choices. The decision-making process is designed to ensure that decisions are well-informed, rational, and aligned with the needs and objectives of your problem's solution.

#### Five steps of good decision-making
* Create a productive environment for decision-making.
* Generate appropriate options, ideas, and alternatives.
* Investigate alternative choices.
* Select appropriate decision-making tools.
* Implement the decision.

#### Creating a productive environment for decision-making
A productive decision-making environment ensures clear communication, collaboration, and unbiased choices. It promotes informed decisions, efficient processes, conflict resolution, and innovation.

To make a good decision, you need to create a productive environment that fosters creativity and participation from others while focusing on the key objective of the decision. When making decisions, it is fundamental to identify what you are trying to accomplish or achieve. In other words, you need to ascertain the objective of each decision. The objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and attainable within a certain time frame. A decision may be made with the objective of solving a problem.

The decision-making process is entirely dependent on the following factors:
* time
* availability
* experience
* buy-in and commitment of the people involved
* the relative importance of the decision

Once these factors have been taken into consideration, the people involved in the decision-making also need to reach a consensus on the process or model to be adopted.

##### Decision-making process or model
* rational planning process
* alternative recognition-primed decision-making model

##### The rational planning process follows five steps:
* One: Creating a productive environment
* Two: Generating appropriate options and ideas
* Three: Investigating alternative choices
* Four: Selecting appropriate tools to help make the decision
* Five: Implementing the choice

##### The recognition-primed decision-making model proposed by Gary Klein
It surmises that people with less time and more experience sense make decisions by picking up cues from the situation they face and forming these into recognized patterns based on previous experience. Based on these patterns, the decision-maker chooses a single course of action. There are no options or alternatives considered at any stage. Another consensus that decision-makers need to reach is whether the decision should be made by an individual or leader, or whether the decision is better suited for a group.

##### The Vroom-Jago tool
Proposed by Vroom and Jetton in in 1973 and later modified by Vroom and Jago.

The tool distinguishes five different situations or processes that range from an individual or leader using available information to make a decision to the group as a whole, presenting alternatives and options, and making the decision with the leader acting as a facilitator. 

The model poses seven questions you must answer to decide which situation or process best represents your circumstances. 
* One: Autocratic one, or A1. The lead decision-maker uses all available information to make the decision.
* Two: Autocratic two, or A2. The lead decision-maker asks for information from the group. The group members do not know for what purpose the information will be used. The group offers no opinion. The lead decision-maker makes the decision.
* Three: Consultative one, or C1. The lead decision-maker explains the situation or problem to individual members, but they do not discuss it together as a group. The lead decision-maker makes the final decision.
* Four: Consultative two, or C2. There is a group discussion where the lead decision-maker explains the situation and gathers ideas and suggestions. The lead decision-maker makes the final decision.
* Five: Group two, or G2. The group as a whole makes the decision. The lead decision-maker presents the situation, and then the group defines alternatives and reaches a consensus. The leader is more of a facilitator.

The Vroom Jago model uses a decision tree to outline the decision-making process. Working from left to right, for example, if you ask question one, "Is a good solution critically important?" and the answer is no, then you ask question four. The group members have to accept the decision for it to work. If the answer to this question is no, then you use process A1 where the lead decision-maker uses all available information to make the decision by themselves. However, if the answer to question four is yes, you then ask question five. If the leader makes the decision alone, will it be accepted? If the answer to this is no, then you use process G2, where the group as a whole makes the decision with the lead decision-maker acting as a facilitator. If the decision is to be a group decision, individuals need to work toward their decision as part of a team.

##### Groupthink
Groupthink is a way of thinking exhibited by a group of people focused on reaching an agreement without a conflict or excessive cost.

###### The advantage of groupthink
* Members of the decision-making team work together toward a common objective testing, analyzing, and evaluating the group's ideas.

###### Disadvantages of groupthink
* Can also lead to irrational or bad decisions.
* It suppresses negative points of view.
* Individuals with opinions different than that of the majority can feel ostracized.
* Powerful leaders can suppress individuals' thoughts and opinions. Individuals stop asking questions.
* Stereotypes are formed. Ideas are rejected before they are fully investigated.
* Individuals who fit in are rewarded, whereas those whose opinions differ are not rewarded.
* Solutions are not revisited once the majority of group members have accepted them.

###### Factors to be introduced into the decision-making process to counter the disadvantages
* Discourage the group leader from making his or her opinions known too soon in the discussions.
* Critically evaluate each suggested solution.
* Bring in an outsider to check the process, for example, an internal audit or the operational risk department.
* Allow anonymous feedback.

##### Role of Creativity in Decision-Making
Creativity, when harnessed in decision-making, can help identify alternatives and options, which in turn optimize the decision-making process. Creativity can be defined as experimenting, taking risks, making mistakes, and inventing new ways of working to optimize creative thinking.

Decision-makers need to feel comfortable and supported. To enable this feeling, you need to focus on two primary factors: decision-makers and the physical environment. Ask the decision-makers what gives them inspiration both in and out of the workplace. Listen to opinions and ideas without judging them. Encourage suggestions, no matter how irrelevant they first appear. Explain concepts and ideas rather than just forcing them on the team. Encourage cross-functional and vertical or horizontal two-way dialog and reward good ideas.

##### Decisions that are being made to solve problems
The decision-making process can be long and arduous and can use up valuable resources. You need to ensure that the correct issue is always addressed and the most appropriate questions are asked. 

###### Techniques can help to identify underlying causes
* Root Cause Analysis -  problems are solved not by treating the symptoms, but by drilling down to the actual root cause and addressing it. This should prevent the problem from recurring, rather than just instigating a quick fix.
* Five Whys is a technique that originated in Japan and is used in a root cause analysis. Drill down into the problem by asking why up to five times until the true cause of the issue or problem is identified.
* Fishbone analysis is a tool that provides a systematic way of looking at effects and their causes. The following steps are involved in creating the fishbone diagram.
One: Put the problem or issue in the fish's head.
 * Two: Label the bones of the fish according to major categories. For example, place procedure, people, policies or methods, material machines, and manpower.
 * Three: For each category, identify factors that may affect the problem.
 * Four: For each of these factors, ask why it is happening until no more useful information emerges.
 * Five: Analyze the results. If items' appear in more than one key category, they tend to be the most likely causes of the problem, and the team should focus its attention on investigating these items.
 
##### Meaning of productive decision-making environment
* setting an appropriate objective or goal
* agreeing whether the process is to be individual or group
* whether it is to be a rational planning process or a recognition primed model
* encouraging creativity
* allowing everyone in the group to have their say
* managing groupthink
* asking the appropriate levels and types of questions

### Generating solution options, ideas, and alternatives
By taking the time to participate in a method for generating multiple solution options, you increase the creativity of the solution that will solve the identified problem.

#### Creative thinking techniques and tools
* brainstorming
* reverse brainstorming
* brain steering
* reframing matrix

A concept to be aware of when trying to identify the best options, ideas, and alternatives and to optimize decision-making is that of mindsets.

A mindset is defined as a fixed mental attitude or disposition that predetermines responses and interpretations of a situation. There are many instances where a suitable alternative is suggested and someone will react, such as, "That's no good, we have tried it before." Or "There's no way that will work." Such reactions are based not on evidence or fact, but feelings based on mindsets.

#### Brainstorming
Brainstorming is a traditional method that suits extroverted, creative groups where group members are given a situation and asked, in a prescribed time, to think of and document as many ideas as they can. The aim of this approach is to stimulate a discussion and interest and to demonstrate the group's existing knowledge of the situation.

#### Reverse brainstorming
Reverse brainstorming works well with groups that prefer analysis. In this process, groups are given a question such as, "How can customer service be improved?" The question is then rephrased to "How can we cause customers to be dissatisfied?" By working on this reverse question, the group identifies what causes dissatisfaction so they can come up with solutions, which, in turn, improves customer satisfaction.

#### Brain steering
Brain steering is an approach that was first introduced by Kevin Coyne and Shane Coyne. This is a more structured approach, and it suits groups with an analytical and structured style. It is similar to brainstorming in that it takes the creative energy from brainstorming activity, but steers it in a more productive direction by asking groups to solve more specific questions and issues rather than just capturing any idea about the situation.

#### The charette procedure, named after the French word for wagon
The charette procedure works well for larger groups where people are sometimes inhibited in giving their opinions due to the size of the group. It works well to split the group into smaller teams and allow each team to review a question or issue related to the overall objective in a prescribed time. Each team captures its ideas, and then, at the end of a time period, the ideas each team has suggested are passed to the next team, and the process begins again. Think about how influential or famous people from history and industry, for example, Leonardo da Vinci, Condoleezza Rice, Steve Jobs, would approach the decision and what information they would require when doing so. Use this insight to seek your own options, ideas, and alternatives.

#### A reframing matrix
A reframing matrix is a tool that helps you examine the situation from a different view. The issue or situation is placed in the middle of a piece of paper. A grid is drawn around it to form four cells. Each cell contains approaches to the situation seen from a certain perspective. For example, the issue here is how to attract more customers to buy your product. Now you need to identify the approaches to this situation and write each approach in a new cell.

These approaches may include:
* Product: What does the product actually do?
* Planning: Can we buy enough inventories to supply demand?
* Potential: What will our customers want to include? and
* People: What do our customers actually need from our product?

#### The Pyramid Principle
Developed by Barbara Minto, the pyramid principle helps to structure thoughts and ideas in such a way that the person looking at the pyramid immediately understands what the author is trying to say. The principle relies on logical analysis and reasoning. Its structure leads the reader through the pyramid by encouraging him or her to ask why each time he or she has moved through a level. The following three rules govern the pyramid structure:
* The ideas are presented from the top down, with the main statement, issue, or question at the top.
* Ideas at each level of the pyramid are summaries of the ideas grouped below.
* These ideas can be either inductive or deductive.

### Personality traits and their impact on creative thinking
* Extroverted or Introverted
* Analytical or Beliefs-Driven
* Creative or Practical
* Flexible or Structured

### Generate solutions with mind mapping 
Using a mind map, you can take a complex problem and break it down into smaller, more manageable segments

#### Characteristics of mind mapping
* At the center of your map is where you place the main idea, topic, or focus of the mapping project. It should be represented by a central image.
* The principal themes branch out from the central image, or you could say that these themes radiate from that central location. This represents the concept of radiant thinking that we mentioned earlier. You should also connect an image or keyword with each theme that emerges.
* Any lower-level topics branch out from the principal themes, so your map will be an arrangement of connected lines or branches, images, and words.

#### Creating a mind map steps:
1. Create your initial map, which focuses on the main idea or central theme of the problem. 
2. Revise the map to fine tune its contents.
3. Take a break to allow new ideas and thoughts to emerge.
4. Reconstruct the map to add or remove ideas generated during the break.
5. Finalize your map.

#### Potential solution: Conflict management
Conflict management is the process of handling and resolving disagreements, disputes, or clashes that arise between individuals, groups, or organizations.

#####  Mindsets and Skills that help in Effective Conflict Management
* Self-respect
* Respect for others
* Appropriate assertiveness
* Effective listening

##### Conflict management strategies
* Avoiding - Do not discuss the conflict.
* Competing - I must get my way.
* Accommodating - I will just give in to what others want.
* Collaborating - Let's work together to find a solution that meets everyone's needs fully and also enhances our interpersonal relationships.
* Compromising - I will give up something to get something in return. Halfway between assertiveness and cooperativeness; Balance between Competing and Accomodation.

### Assess Alternative Solutions
#### Investigate alternative solutions
##### Risk Matrix
The matrix helps you to plot the status of each outcome or risk by mapping it according to probability and impact. For example, if an outcome is in the bottom right corner, then the probability of that event happening is rare, but if it did happen it would have a huge impact on the business. You would want to put measures in place to manage that risk and estimate the cost of doing so. However, if an outcome is in the bottom left corner with a rare probability and an immaterial impact, then you would not expend time or money trying to manage it. 

##### Premortem Approach - Technique to evaluate options, ideas, and alternatives
The group works from the supposition that the idea has failed. Each member is asked to document independently his or her reasons for the failure. By doing this independently, people are less likely to be swayed by politics or groupthink. Each person is asked to read aloud one reason from his or her list, and each reason is collated in a master list.

#### Assess whether the benefits to the organization of following a particular route outweigh the costs of doing so
* Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), an economic-based approach popular in both private and state-run organizations.
* The Categories of Pros and Cons, or advantages and disadvantages. 

##### The Categories of Pros and Cons
This approach involves the following steps:
1. Draw a table with two columns for each option.
2. Title the columns, one with pros and the other with cons for each option.
3. Write down as many effects or implications of each option in the appropriate columns.
4. Give each effect, awaiting according to its importance as per the original objective of the decision.
5. Add up each column and write down the total.
6. Compare the two columns for each option to evaluate whether the pros outweigh the cons and by how much. The bigger the difference, the more attractive the option.
7. Each option can then be compared to evaluate which is the most attractive.

#### Decision tree analysis
Decision tree analysis simplifies complex decisions by mapping options, potential outcomes, and probabilities, such as costs and benefits.

Most business models contain dependent, independent, controllable, and non-controllable factors or variables, while decision trees only contain controllable factors. The pathways of decision tree analysis often reveal options not considered or included in the business model, but that can affect the company's bottom line. Thus, these options need to be evaluated for practicality and probability to determine whether the logic and calculation sequences of the business model should be updated to incorporate these new functionalities to ensure the model's complete integrity.

### Make a Decision
#### Decision criteria
##### Step 1. Establishing decision criteria
* Clear deal-breakers
* Lowcost solution
* Key factors

##### Step 2. Analyzing potential alternatives
* Cost-prohibitive option
* Trade-Offs and Lower-Cost Solutions
* Expert insight

#### Techniques to make a decision
* Simple voting: Care must be taken here as the vote can be impacted by politics and groupthink.
* Anonymous voting: Group members do not see each other casting their votes, but instead they write down their view. The views are then reviewed by the facilitator, who summarizes them and makes the final decision known to the whole group.
* Decision matrix: Alternatives are considered according to the criteria and ranked accordingly.
* Decision tree: The decision is mapped out on a structured diagram to help visualize the journey.

##### A decision matrix or Pugh matrix
1. Draw a table with the alternatives or options across the top as column headers and the criteria or factors down the left side as row headers.
2. Weight the criteria so that the most important criterion gets the highest weighting, perhaps a five, and the least important gets the lowest weighting, perhaps a one.
3. Rank the options in an order that fits the criteria best for each criterion, assign a score, for example, with one being the lowest and five being the highest.
4. Calculate the overall score for each option by summing up the scores allocated.
5. Choose the option with the highest score.

##### A decision tree
When designing a decision tree, adhere to the following principles:
* Construct the tree from left to right.
* Evaluate the tree from right to left, working backwards.

Steps to design a decision tree:

1. Draw a tree

    A. On the left side of a piece of paper, draw a rectangle to represent the first decision.
    B. Draw lines coming out of this rectangle, moving to the right to represent possible solutions.
    C. Label your rectangle and lines carefully.
    D. At the end of each line, draw the result. If it is an outcome, draw a triangle. If it is another decision, draw another rectangle, and if it is a possibility, draw a circle.
    E. Continue drawing toward the right, labeling each point and line carefully until each line reaches an outcome or endpoint.

2. Assign values

    A. Assign cache values or scores to each outcome. 
    B. Assign costs to each line where required. 
    C. Assign probabilities to each possibility based on experience or research.

3. Evaluate

    A. Starting from the right side and moving to the left through the tree. At each decision point, calculate the value of that decision. It may be necessary to multiply outcomes by probabilities or cost by probabilities to get the expected value of a solution. Once an expected value has been calculated, this is then used in further calculations. 
    B. Continue this calculation process from right to left until the first decision point is reached. The total value can then be calculated and used to help make the decision.

#### The most common psychological traps
* <b>The overconfidence trap</b>: Being too confident in the accuracy of predictions. For example, overconfidence can result in predicting a sales increase of 4% to 5%, when in reality the sales increase will be closer to 0.5%. 
* <b>The recall ability trap</b>: Being overly influenced by dramatic events. For example, when asked for the probability of a plane crashing, respondents consistently overestimate the answer since a crash is so dramatic. 
* <b>The prudence trap</b>: A factor is added or taken away just to be safe. For example, the amount of inventory to carry in the supply chain will often be far higher than required, just to be safe.
* <b>The anchoring trap</b>: When making a decision, the decision-makers focus more on the first piece of information they receive. For example, past events or trends are often used as a way of estimating new figures without much regard to changing factors or circumstances.
* <b>The sunk cost trap</b>: Choices are made that justify past choices even though they may no longer be valid. For example, continually putting more money into expanding a business even though the business is unlikely to recover. 
* <b>The confirming evidence trap</b>: Decision-makers seek out information to confirm their current point of view rather than contradict it. For example, asking sales analysts to provide evidence to back up sales forecasts when looking to expand production.
* <b>The framing trap</b>: Problems are poorly framed so that incorrect decisions are made. For example, if a salesperson was asking for approval on a new product and said there is a one in ten chance of this product succeeding, there would likely be a different reaction from his manager than if he said there is a 90% chance this product will fail, although the actual outcomes are identical. 
* <b>The status quo trap</b>: Decision-makers display a bias toward options that continue the current position. For example, when designing a new product, the resulting design is very similar to the existing one.

### Knowledge Check
* <b>A single idea can spark innovation and a cutting-edge solution</b>. Mind mapping contributes to a company’s competitive advantage in many ways like, one simple idea that can spark powerful innovation and a cutting-edge solution.
* <b>The ideas are presented from the top down</b>. In the pyramid principle, the ideas are presented top down with ideas at each grouping logically ordered. Ideas at each level are summaries of the ideas grouped below.
* <b>I must get my way</b>. The underlying intent of competing as a strategy for managing conflict is, “I must get my way.”
* <b>People base decisions on recognized patterns from prior experiences</b>. The recognition-primed decision-making model proposed by Gary Klein, a research psychologist on decision-making, surmises that people with less time and more experience sense make decisions by picking up cues from the situation they face and forming these into recognized patterns based on previous experience
* <b>Let's collaborate to find a mutually satisfying solution</b>. The underlying intent of collaborating as a strategy for managing conflict is, let’s work together to find a solution that meets everyone’s needs fully.

### Summary
* Creating a productive environment for decision-making.
* The process of generating appropriate solutions, mind mapping process, and conflict management strategies.
* The importance of choosing appropriate decision making tools.

## Decision-Making Best Practices
### Pre-assessment
* <b>A high degree of interrelatedness among alternatives and/or resources<b>. A high degree of interrelatedness among alternatives and/or resources can make a decision more complex. Therefore, a small number of alternatives, a concise plan and involvement of a few people would not make a decision more complex.
* <b>Contemplating only one option</b>. While contemplating a decision, all available options should be given equal consideration. Therefore, contemplating only one option will not help to focus on decision quality, but rather it will dilute it. Avoiding result is helpful in decision-making because it assumes the relationship between decision quality and outcome quality is correlated to a much greater extent than it actually is. Considering decision-making parameters is helpful to decision-making.
* <b>Developing community goodwill</b>. While the goal of any decision-making process or method is to make good decisions, collaborative decision making is generally not a quick process. Achieving unanimous support for decisions and making decisions that ensure 100% buy-in are not the goals for using collaborative decision-making for communities and organizations. The main goal is to develop community goodwill, both toward leaders and other community members.
* <b>A group dynamic that discourages individual thinking in favor of group consensus</b>. A group dynamic that discourages individual thinking in favor of group consensus is a key component of a popular groupthink definition.
* <b>Failing</b>. The best way to reduce overconfidence is to fail. The more one succeeds, the more confident one may become.

### Collaborative Decision-Making
Collaborative decision-making can be used for making decisions that affect whole organizations or communities, for making decisions that are complex and involve stakeholders, and for solving problems. Collaborative decision-making is also used to increase accountability and buy-in.

Decision-making and problem solving are sometimes confused, but they are not the same. Decision-making is centered on choosing between alternatives. Problem solving may involve decision-making, but it is a process used to resolve an issue or create change. Solving problems often involves making many decisions. 

For example, you need to know:
* the problem to be solved
* who will be involved in solving the problem
* what resources are available to solve the problem

Collaborative decision-making is often utilized by organizational leaders who need to make decisions for the people they represent. Research has shown that including community and organization members in a collaborative decision-making process helps remove or reduce barriers to achieving collective goals and can sometimes enhance measurable outcomes. Collaborative decision-making also makes those included feel they contributed to decisions that affect them and other community members, creating enhanced community support, trust, and group morale. The net result is the development of community goodwill both toward leaders and other community members.

Employee participation can vary from individual participation within a team to representative participation, wherein a group representative is directly involved with other group participants, helping provide research, input, and often the benefit of their own personal experience. Employees should also be encouraged to interact with anyone. In most of these cases, the inclusion of employees in the decision-making process is more important than the form of their participation.

### Collaborative Decision-Making Methods
* <b>Majority</b> - requires more than 50% of group members to agree on the chosen decision. It can lead to the oppression of minorities - known as tyranny of the majority/masses -> Modification: a two thirds supermajority vote is required.
* <b>Consensus</b> - requires general agreement on the final decision and unified support for implementing the decision. It requires group members to agree <b>to support a decision</b> that the group collectively agrees upon, even though every group member <b>may not agree with the decision</b>.
* <b>Unanimity</b> - requires all group members to agree on the chosen decision. Some groups who use this method implement constructive abstention, meaning that if a group member does not vote, and if everyone else who does vote is in agreement, it is considered a unanimous vote. The method could potentially bring the process to a halt.  
* <b>Authority</b> - employs the collaborative efforts of others, while the final decision is made by the final decision maker like CEOs, CFOs, and department heads in large organizations. May not create strong accountability and buy-in.
* <b>Delphi</b> - is generally used with expert participants and has four key characteristics: anonymity of participants, structured information flow, regular feedback, and a specific role of the group facilitator. Anonymity mitigates the effects of personal biases, provides greater freedom of expression, allows for more open and honest discussions, and mitigates the negative effects on participants of being wrong. The Delphi method can be very time consuming.

### Collaborative Decision-Making Process
#### Structured Process of Decision-Making
* Stating the Decision
* Gathering Information
* Analyzing the Available Options
* Choosing an Option and Acting On It
* Evaluating the Results 

##### Stating the Decision
It is important to establish measurable objectives to evaluate the effectiveness of your decision. Although goals and objectives are not the same, objectives should follow the SMART criteria, be:
* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Realistic 
* Time bound

##### Gathering Information
There is a delicate balance between not enough information and too much information.

Information is only useful if it can be assimilated and analyzed to help make the decision.

When gathering information during collaborative decision-making, consider two key factors.
1. What information to gather?
2. At what level of detail?

##### Analyzing the Available Options
First establish clear decision criteria and then analyze alternatives. After analyzing the available options, you need to choose one. To choose wisely, weigh the pros and cons of the alternatives based on how well they meet your stated decision-making criteria.

##### Choosing an Option and Acting On It
It is important to recognize the risks related to different alternatives. Erroneous assumptions and inaccurate estimates of probable outcomes are the main causes of risky decision-making. To choose an option, envision what will happen after the decision is made and consider any consequences.

##### Evaluating the Results
Evaluate to what degree the decision solved the problem, or possibly, the reason why the decision did not have the desired result. It is the human element of being open about the effectiveness of decisions that is often difficult.

### Pros and cons of collaborative decision-making
#### Advantages
**Shared Information** - to ensure that information is effectively shared, you need to communicate the information in a way that provides context and allows people to ask questions. This feedback loop reduces miscommunications.
**Diverse Skill Sets** - tp combine them to enhance decision outcomes.

#### Disadvantages
**Diffusion of Responsibility**
**Inefficiency/Time Inefficiency**
**Peer Pressure** - self-interest that are not aligned with group goals, and other social dynamics.

##### Diffusion of Responsibility
###### Defining Diffusion of Responsibility
People feel less accountable.

##### Avoiding Diffused Responsibility
Set personal responsibility at the outset of the decision-making process and reinforce this responsibility throughout the process.

#### Understanding groupthink
Groupthink is a process that occurs when a group of people prioritize consensus over critical thinking.

Princeton educated sociologist and author William H. White Jr. White described groupthink as the desire to conform to group values that results in irrational or dysfunctional decision-making results. 

Irving Lester Janus was a researcher and professor at Yale University, stated that groupthink is an excessive form of concurrence seeking among group members. His study of groupthink included working on the American Soldier Project, which was the first comprehensive study of its kind that examined attitudes of soldiers in combat, as well as the book titled Groupthink, which was published in 1972. 

##### Characteristics of Groupthink
* conformity or agreement
* overriding belief that the value of being a group member was good and right and more important than other decision-making criteria

##### Processes to Avoid Groupthink
* Ensure that your process clearly communicates the group goals, objectives.
* Ensure decision alternatives that are being considered.
* Develop Rapport and Trust - make sure the decision-making environment feels safe for those involved so that they can offer information and suggestions without hesitation.
* State explicitly that it is acceptable and even encouraged to discuss dissenting opinions when they can add value to the decision-making process.
* Check opinions for objectivity and encourage members to share different ideas.
* Include a variety of personality types in the decision-making group.

##### Groupthink Indicators
* Quick decisions about alternatives
* Poorly explained dismissals of alternatives
* Ignoring or unreasonably downplaying risks, especially those of an alternative
* Body language

None of these, in isolation, would be a major red flag, but when considered together, they were telling indicators of groupthink in action. Groupthink can result in poor decision-making and can create dysfunction if it takes root.

### Cognitive and Other Factors Impacting Decision-Making
One of the major concepts supporting the idea that decision-making is steeped in emotions is called motivated reasoning. This type of reasoning causes people to approach, build, and assess arguments and other information in a biased way that is specifically aimed at achieving a desired conclusion. Motivated reasoning is more than confirmation bias.

During decision-making, an individual's emotional and cognitive states help them to evaluate the perceived risks and benefits of the decision, which then leads to an outcome.

Businesses regularly engage in decision-making amid uncertainty. Decision-makers often face the problem of incomplete or unknown information that could potentially affect their decisions and outcomes. 

Known unknowns are factors that you are aware of but are not fully informed about. Unknown unknowns, also called blind spots, are factors you are not aware of. Unknown unknowns that have a major impact are called black swans.

Rational decision-making involves sound judgment and reasoning. This is a good way to make decisions, but science suggests that human nature causes people to act irrationally all the time.

Doctor Dan Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University, refers to irrational decision-making as the cost of zero cost. This concept encapsulates the consequences of acquiring items with a zero cost, even though it may be disadvantageous to do so.

Another irrational behavior that is commonly encountered while making decisions involving large projects is the irrational attachment to money that has already been spent. This behavior is known as the sunk-cost fallacy, and it often leads to poor decisions because of an irrational valuation of money that cannot be recouped.

Minimizing the impact of irrational behavior will positively affect your decision-making. Along with factoring in irrational decisions, mitigating known unknowns also improves desired outcomes from your decisions. Finally, among vital decision-making scenarios, understanding the important role emotions play and how to use them effectively will improve your decision-making.

### Behavioral biases in decision-making 
* **Representativeness bias** - leads people to extrapolate past trends, ignore reversion and sample sizes in making predictions, and develop misperceptions about chance.
* **Overconfidence bias** - a universal trait in humans, often leading to unpleasant surprises.
* **Anchoring and adjustment bias** - causes conservative adjustments in forecasts when given new information, and the anchor appears to matter even if it is irrelevant.
* **Prospect theory and loss aversion** - demonstrates how people separate gains and losses into middle accounts and how they base their decisions with regard to risk-taking on these accounts. People tend to feel more pain with small losses than gratification with large gains. This could lead to people being reluctant to sell or abandon failing projects.

#### Analyzing representativeness bias
Representativeness bias occurs when people tend to make judgments or decisions based on how well they believe something or someone represents a certain category or prototype.

##### Results of representativeness bias
* People ignore reversions and extrapolate.
* They ignore the sample size and predictions and have certain misperceptions of chance.

#### Analyzing overconfidence bias
Overconfidence bias occurs when individuals overestimate their own abilities, knowledge, or the accuracy of their judgments and predictions.

Overconfidence leads to decisions that destroy value. Overconfident people make aggressive forecasts and take excessive risks.

Overconfidence is beneficial too. If people were not overconfident, society would not have had as many life improving innovations.

Overconfidence appears to be a universal trait in humans. Our overconfidence frequently leads us to unpleasant surprises.

#### Analyzing anchoring and adjustment bias
Anchoring and adjustment bias occurs when people make decisions or judgments based on initial reference points or anchors.

When decision-makers need to respond to new information, they adjust their expectations based on an anchor. These anchors may not be relevant, and the adjustments may not be sufficient, but people still tend to use the anchors in their estimation. Anchors are preexisting opinions and facts that people use to form their expectations for the future. Surprises occur when the future does not reflect these expectations.

#### Analyzing prospect theory and loss aversion
Prospect theory is a behavioral economic theory, which aims to describe how people make decisions under uncertainty and how they evaluate potential gains and losses. One of the key elements of prospect theory is loss aversion, which refers to the tendency of people to weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains.

A loss-making or profitable situation is an example of a frame. People behave differently in different frames. Some are loss-averse, which means they do not like to recognize losses. They often take more risk in loss-making situations than they do in profitable situations.

### Common Decision-Making Mistakes
Common decision-making mistakes occur due to factors such as insufficient information, biases, rushed decisions, overconfidence, group dynamics, neglecting alternatives, ignoring feedback, anchoring, decision fatigue, external pressures, and unclear goals. Recognizing these reasons helps in addressing and minimizing such errors. 

#### Ways to improve decision quality
* learn how to change your decision-making mindset
* document crucial decision assumptions
* establish standards for good decisions
* improve the chance of being successful at decision-making by rewarding quality decisions at the right time

Focusing on **decision quality** rather than **outcome quality** is an important parameter to cultivate a habit of informed decision-making. 

Assuming that the relationship between decision quality and outcome quality is correlated to a much greater extent than it actually is - this can cause you to inaccurately assess decision quality. So, assess decision quality at the time you make your decision.

You must establish metrics and reward systems that focus on decision quality and assessing it **at the time of the decision**, not after outcomes are known. 

Focus on how effectively people use the decision parameters, including frame of reference, well thought out options, good information, clearly stated desired outcomes, clear and logical reasoning, and the action taken on the decision. This focus shift is easier when you document the decision process and assumptions, which can then serve as both a checklist and assessment tool for good decision-making.

#### Enhancing decision quality
##### Documenting decision assumptions
* Utilize a structured checklist format to record crucial information related to decision-making.
* Focus on the "what, why, who, where, and source" of each assumption for clarity, rationale, accountability, and data integrity in decision-making.
* Emphasize data-driven decision-making, rely on historical data while avoiding known variables.
* Monitor continuously and update assumptions to keep decisions aligned with changing circumstances.

##### Rewarding good decisions
* Introduce incentives to motivate and recognize individuals or teams for prioritizing decision quality.
* Acknowledge and appreciate those who make well-documented and informed decisions.
* Set specific metrics for decision quality and reward those who consistently meet these metrics.
* Establish a continuous feedback loop to encourage continuous
improvement in decision quality.

### Implementing a Decision
The final step in the decision-making process is the implementation of the decision, where you need to communicate your chosen solution.

#### Effective Communication Features
* Repeating the key objectives and outcomes: Ideas become ingrained through the repetition of messages.
* Dialogue: A two-way communication obtains buy-in and commitment.
* Simplicity: Keep messages simple to avoid confusion.
* Channels of communication: Use a number of channels to spread the information, including written, oral, visual, large meetings, small groups, or informal gatherings.
* Consistency: Ensure that everyone understands the information in the same way and all decision-makers are committed to the outcome, even those individuals who may have voted against it in the process.
* Stories: Use stories and analogies to help solidify the message.
* Lead by example: The leader or project manager must show commitment to the decision. Any inconsistent messages will be noticed by the rest of the organization.

#### Vital Steps for Gaining Buy-In and Commitment
* Share a sense of importance and urgency with everyone impacted by the decision. Describe what the consequences will be at the proposed course of action is not followed.
* Have a number of champions to spread the word who believe strongly in the outcome, and who have the power to share this passion.
* Develop and share the goal or objective so that everyone understands where the decision is taking them or the organization.
* Empower others for action through structural support, good management, technical support, and training to force through the decision and any changes required.
* Generate short-term wins by including some short-term targets in the implementation phase. If people have to wait too long before they see any benefits from the decision, they will lose enthusiasm and faith in the change.
* Consolidate gains and keep going. Don’t simply celebrate what has been achieved and stop.
* Anchor the decision in the organization's or group's culture to ensure its long-term survival. Many decisions and changes can fail when the key decision-maker moves on to something new.

#### The skills required to effectively drive through the implementation of a decision for the long term
* Integrity, which is being true to one’s beliefs and values.
* Relationship focus, which is gaining the trust of others.
* Vision, which is both short term and long term.
* Persuasion, which is being able to persuade others to follow your lead.
* Motivation, which is encouraging others to perform well.
* Adaptability, which is being able to change course, if required.
* Team focus, which is being able to work in a team environment and bring out the best in others.
* Communication, which is being able to enhance the flow of information both between people and throughout the organization.
* Bravery, which is being able to take responsibility for things that may have gone wrong.

#### Theory suggests that there are two dimensions of leadership behavior that impact leadership style
* Task orientation: The extent that a leader engages in one-way communication, spells out tasks to others, and tells people what, how, and when to do something.
* People orientation: Two-way communication, listening, supporting, encouraging, interacting, and involving others.

#### Hersey and Blanchard's situational leadership model. This model proposes four styles of leadership that are effective in implementing a decision
* **Directing**: The leader works with the teams, structuring and organizing them.
* **Coaching**: The leader supports the team in making and implementing the decisions.
* **Facilitating**: The leader’s main activity is to praise, support, and collate views.
* **Delegating**: The leader gives full responsibility to others to make and implement the decision.

#### If a person has the appropriate skills to be an effective leader, then the style adopted to implement the decision and subsequent required changes can flex depending on the following three key things:
* The situation
* The importance of the outcome
* The experience or skills of the other people involved

### Knowledge Check
* **Create open discussions with group members**. **Provide feedback to group members**. **Keep group members informed during the decision-making process**. To increase accountability and buy-in, leaders should create open discussions with group members, provide feedback to them, and keep them informed throughout the decision-making process.
* **Empowers employees, promotes innovation, leads to a inclusive and productive work environment**. Collaborative decision-making empowers employees, promotes innovation, enhances problem solving, and contributes to a more inclusive and productive work environment.
* **Reducing the effects of diffusion of responsibility**. Collaborative decision-making includes advantages such as shared information and more diverse skill sets, and potential disadvantages of diffusion of responsibility and protracted decision-making. Time saving is not an advantage of collaborative decision making. The specific process described is most focused on reducing the effects of diffusion of responsibility.
* **Clearly communicate group goals from the outset of the decision-making process**. Clearly communicating group goals from the outset of the decision-making process is an effective strategy for avoiding groupthink.
* **Decision-making elements were ignored while the outcome was stressed**. The manager stressed the outcome rather than concentrating on the decision-making elements for making a sound and logical decision, which led to a poor result. Manager's assumptions and qualification to execute the task and employees’ competency are factors that could have been rectified with logical decision-making.

### Summary
* Collaborative decision-making empowers employees, promotes innovation, enhances problem solving, and contributes to a more inclusive and productive work environment. 
* Common decision-making mistakes occur due to factors such as insufficient information, behavior biases, rushed decisions, overconfidence, group dynamics, neglecting alternatives, ignoring feedback, anchoring, decision fatigue, external pressures, and unclear goals. 
* Implementing decisions and solutions is crucial as it turns strategies into reality, driving actual progress and determining the effectiveness of chosen courses of action
