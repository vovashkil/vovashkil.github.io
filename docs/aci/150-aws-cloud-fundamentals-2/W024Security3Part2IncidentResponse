## AWS Incident Response

Introduction

A security incident is any impact on business operations that runs counter to your organization's policies or standard security practices. This module discusses incident response within the context of the AWS Cloud. However, it’s important to begin by familiarizing yourself with general examples of what constitutes a security event and incident.

Events and incidents

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines both security events and incidents. These terms are described in the following sections.

Events


An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. Not all events are bad or lead to incidents. Examples of events include the following:

A user connecting to a file share
A server receiving a request for a webpage
A user sending email
A firewall blocking a connection attempt
Adverse events

NIST defines an adverse event as an event with a negative consequence. Adverse events can include the following:

Hardware failures
Denial of service attacks
Unauthorized use of system privileges
Unauthorized access to sensitive data
Malware that destroys data
Incident response focuses on adverse events related to services in the AWS Cloud.


Incidents


NIST defines a computer security incident as a violation or an imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Examples of incidents include the following:

A threat actor uses a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which causes an organization's website to crash.
A threat actor obtains sensitive data and threatens that the details will be released publicly if the organization does not pay a designated sum of money.
A user provides or exposes sensitive information to others through peer-to-peer file-sharing services.
Indicators of compromise

Events are the primary source of indicators of compromise (IoCs). IoCs refer to observable artifacts, such as log entries or access patterns, that might indicate the presence of a security breach, malicious activity, or unauthorized access within your AWS environment. These IoCs can be used to detect, investigate, and respond to potential security incidents. Examples of IoCs in the AWS Cloud include the following:

•
Unauthorized API calls – Unusual or suspicious API calls recorded in AWS CloudTrail logs, such as API calls from unfamiliar IP addresses, unauthorized Regions, or unexpected services.

•
Unusual resource usage patterns – Abnormal spikes or deviations in resource usage, such as sudden increases in network traffic, CPU utilization, or data transfer volumes, which might indicate malicious activities like cryptocurrency mining or data exfiltration.

•
Suspicious network traffic – Network traffic patterns that deviate from the norm, such as connections to known malicious IP addresses, unusual port scanning activities, or unauthorized inbound/outbound traffic flows.

•
Unauthorized access attempts – Failed login attempts, brute-force attacks, or unauthorized access attempts recorded in AWS service logs, such as Amazon GuardDuty findings or AWS WAF logs.

•
Unauthorized resource creation or modification – Unexpected creation, modification, or deletion of AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, or IAM roles, which might indicate the presence of unauthorized actors or compromised credentials.

•
Suspicious user behavior – User activities that deviate from established baselines or patterns, such as accessing resources from unusual locations, performing actions outside of normal working hours, or exhibiting behavior inconsistent with their role or responsibilities.

•
Known malware signatures or hashes – Presence of known malware signatures, hashes, or indicators identified by security intelligence sources within your AWS environment, such as infected EC2 instances or compromised container images.

•
Unauthorized software installations – Unauthorized or unexpected software installations on EC2 instances, containers, or other AWS resources, which might indicate the presence of malware or unauthorized modifications.

•
Misconfigured security settings – Insecure configurations or deviations from security best practices, such as open security groups, overly permissive IAM policies, or disabled logging or monitoring services.

By continuously monitoring for these and other IoCs, organizations can enhance their ability to detect potential security incidents within their AWS environment and take appropriate actions to investigate and mitigate the threats.
