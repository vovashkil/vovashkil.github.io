## Course structure

This course is a combination of digital e-learning content that you can read, watch, and engage with on your own time and instructor-led training sessions (ILTs) that focus on the topics presented in the e-learning.

### Instructor-Led Training (ILT) Sessions

Attendance at ILT sessions is strongly encouraged, but attendance does not count toward course completion. You can use the ILT sessions to explore concepts presented in the online learning content in greater depth, connect with AWS instructors and ACI learners, and prepare for the weekly final assessment. All ILT sessions, with the exception of office hours, are recorded and will be available on-demand for you to watch when you have time. Multiple live ILT sessions are offered each day to accommodate a range of schedules. This schedule can be found on your SkillBuilder learner dashboard.

### Assessments

You must achieve a passing score of 80% or higher on all weekly assessments to pass the course. Each weekly final assessment consists of a multiple-choice quiz presented at the end of each week's assigned module. You have unlimited opportunities to achieve a passing score on each final assessment. The same 80% passing requirement applies to all final course assessments that appear at the end of the course.

### Weekly Time Commitment

In this 11-week course, you can expect to spend approximately 3 hours each week on e-learning, including hands-on labs and assessments. You also have many opportunities to attend ILT sessions each week, which are available live or on-demand. Although ILT attendance is not required for course completion, each session is an opportunity to connect with and learn from your AWS instructor and other learners.
