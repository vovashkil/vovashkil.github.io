## Lab Overview

This lab provides a Cloud9 based development environment where students can practice Python coding exercises.

Prerequisites
This lab requires:

Access to a computer with Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux (Ubuntu, SuSE, or Red Hat)
A modern internet browser such as Chrome or Firefox
Icon key
Various icons are used throughout this lab to call attention to different types of instructions and notes. The following list explains the purpose for each icon:

 Expected output: A sample output that you can use to verify the output of a command or edited file
 WARNING: An action that is irreversible and could potentially impact the failure of a command or process (including warnings about configurations that cannot be changed after they are made)
Task 1: Connecting to your Cloud9 Environment
At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the  search bar, search for and choose Cloud9.

Select the Cloud9-Lab-IDE Cloud9 IDE. Once the Cloud9 IDE is in the ready state, choose the button Open in Cloud9.

 Expected output: A new browser tab opens displaying the AWS Cloud9 development environment.

 Note: You can also open your Cloud9 environment by copying the Cloud9Environment value from the list to the left of these instructions and then pasting it into a new web browser tab.

 WARNING: Once you begin this lab, it should run for the entire duration of the module. Only choose End Lab when all lab activities for the module are complete. If you choose End Lab before you have completed all lab activities for the module, you will lose the progress you have made, and you will be required to launch a new lab instance. Consider saving your lab code locally each week to help prevent data loss that could occur if the lab ends too soon.
