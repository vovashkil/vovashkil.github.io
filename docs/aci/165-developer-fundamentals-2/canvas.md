# Canvas - Development Fundamentals 2

## Week 11 Resources

### Demo Files

Here are the demo files for this week. The **Jupyter Notebooks** (the ones **ending** in **.ipynb**), as well as their **plain Python** versions (ending in **.py**). The plain versions have the same Python code, but they won't have the nicely formatted text around it.

* **HTTP Requests and REST APIs**:

 * Notebook: [w11-http-overview.ipynb](./canvas_files/w11-http-overview.ipynb)
 * Python: [w11-http-overview.py](./canvas_files/w11-http-overview.py)

* **Binary Search in multiple languages**: This was demoed in a live session, to show that the coding on other programming languages is very similar to what we've learned in Python. We saw the binary search algorithm implemented in Python, Java and C#. I'm including the Java and C# files here, so that anyone can open them in a text editor, and visualize the similarities in the code with Python. However, setting an IDE so you can to run Java or C# code on your own is not in the scope here.

 * Python binary search: [w11-binary_search.py](./canvas_files/w11-binary_search.py)
 * Java binary search: [w11-BinarySearch.java](./canvas_files/w11-BinarySearch.java)

Tucker Quest Application

The Tucker Quest application was something we showed as an example of how object-oriented concepts can be applied to a real application. It was something built over the entire quarter in a previous Fun Friday session. It is not something learners are expected to read an understand this week. I'm including the full code and documentation here, only for those who might be interested in it, since I did show it in the session.

* Zip File with the full code for the application: tucker-quest-v1.6.zip
* Detailed Programmerâ€™s Guide: tucker-quest-programming-guide-v1.2.7.docx
* Instructions for how to import/export projects to Cloud9 (this is standard stuff you probably learned already):  project upload-download instructions.docx

Week 1 Resources

Demo Files:

Here are the demo files for this week. The Jupyter Notebooks (the ones ending in .ipynb), as well as their plain Python versions (ending in .py). The plain versions have the same Python code, but they won't have the nicely formatted text around it.:

* Object-Oriented Inheritance and Polymorphism:

Notebook: w1-oop-inheritance-polymorphism.ipynb
Python: w1-oop-inheritance-polymorphism.py
card_printer module:card_printer.py
(you need to place this utility file in the same folder where you run the Notebook from)

* Object-Oriented Programming Overview:

Notebook: w1-oop-overview.ipynb
Python: w1-oop-overview.py

* Jupyter Notebook Overview:

Notebook: w1-jupyter_overview.ipynb
Python: w1-jupyter_overview.py

Jupyter Notebook:

For those who want to use Jupyter to view the demo files with all the fancy formatting. You have a few options.

*  https://jupyter.org/  - The official Jupyter site. You can download and run Jupyter Lab (that's what you see me using) from the site. That's free open source software. This is not an AWS product, so I don't want to get into installation steps, but you can see everything on their site.
*  https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/ - SageMaker Studio Lab, which is an Amazon supported Jupyter Lab environment in the Cloud. This is  currently free for anyone (no credit card required). Check the website for registration and all details
* Others - Multiple IDEs, including VS Code, will support Jupyter Notebooks
