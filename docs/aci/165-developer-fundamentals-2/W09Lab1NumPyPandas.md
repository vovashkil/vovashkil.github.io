# Data Processing with NumPy and Pandas

## Lab overview

This lab provides hands-on practice with core data analysis skills using Python. You go through the key steps involved in working with data programmatically. First, you import a dataset into Python. Then you use numerical analysis techniques from NumPy to explore the data. Next, you use Pandas for additional data exploration tasks like filtering and sorting. Finally, you create data visualizations to present the insights from your analysis. Completing these tasks provides you practical experience with essential data import, manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. The hands-on nature reinforces these fundamental data skills that are applicable across many real-world data analysis workflows.

Objectives
By the end of this lab, you should be able to do the following:

Use Pandas to import a dataset into Python.
Use NumPy to perform numerical analysis on the data.
Use Pandas for data exploration tasks like filtering and sorting.
Use Matplotlib to create visualizations to present data insights.
Demonstrate core skills needed for data analysis and visualization in Python.
Technical knowledge prerequisites
This hands-on lab assumes that you have completed the Developer Fundamentals 1 (DF1) course and the associated labs.

Duration
This lab requires approximately 60 minutes to complete.

Icon key
Various icons are used throughout this lab to call attention to different types of instructions and notes. The following list explains the purpose for each icon:

 Expected output: A sample output that you can use to verify the output of a command or edited file.
 Note: A hint, tip, or important guidance.
 Task complete: A conclusion or summary point in the lab.
Start lab
To launch the lab, at the top of the page, choose Start Lab.

 Caution: You must wait for the provisioned AWS services to be ready before you can continue.

To open the lab, choose Open Console .

You are automatically signed in to the AWS Management Console in a new web browser tab.

 Warning: Do not change the Region unless instructed.

Common sign-in errors
Error: Choosing Start Lab has no effect
In some cases, certain pop-up or script blocker web browser extensions might prevent the Start Lab button from working as intended. If you experience an issue starting the lab:

Add the lab domain name to your pop-up or script blockerâ€™s allow list or turn it off.
Refresh the page and try again.
Lab environment
For this lab, you are provided with the following resources:

Jupyter Notebook, which provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python data analysis tasks like importing, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.

Supporting Amazon Web Services (AWS) networking infrastructure, including virtual private cloud (VPC), subnets, internet gateway, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to securely access AWS services from the Jupyter notebook.

Services used in this lab
Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter notebook provides an IDE for data exploration and visualization. It supports launching notebooks with preinstalled Python libraries and data visualization tools, and helps developers visualize data and build models in a single environment.

Launch the Jupyter notebook instance
In this task, you launch the Jupyter notebook from where you will continue the rest of the tasks for this lab.

Copy the JupyterNotebook URL value that is listed to the left of these instructions, and paste it into a new browser tab.

 Expected output: You are directed to the Launcher console of a Jupyter notebook.

In the left navigation pane are two files: data-processing.ipynb and movies.csv. These files were included as part of the installation and they will be used in the lab.

From the left navigation pane, open the data-processing.ipynb file.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the tasks.

 Task complete: You have successfully completed the lab.

Conclusion
You have successfully done the following:

Used Pandas to import a dataset into Python
Used NumPy to perform numerical analysis on the data
Used Pandas for data exploration tasks like filtering and sorting
Used Matplotlib to create visualizations to present data insights
Demonstrated core skills needed for data analysis and visualization in Python
End lab
Follow these steps to close the console and end your lab.

Return to the AWS Management Console.

At the upper-right corner of the page, choose AWSLabsUser, and then choose Sign out.

Choose End Lab and then confirm that you want to end your lab.
