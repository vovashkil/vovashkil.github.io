    "We can see that both **merge sort and quick sort** are **much faster than bubble sort**, and that difference becomes **even more pronounced** as the **list grows in size**. In fact we can't even try for a larger list size, or the bubble sort would take too long to run. That illustrates the **marked difference** between an **O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm and** a **O(n log(n)) algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these small sample sizes and number of executions it's harder to compare quicksort and merge sort. So let's repeate the comparison, but without bubble sort, we can try some bigger sizes."
