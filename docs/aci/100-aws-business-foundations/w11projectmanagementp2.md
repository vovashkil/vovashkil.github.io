# Project Management Part 2
## Change Management
### Pre-Assessment
* **Change control process**. Project managers embed a change control process into the project plan to avoid unexpected consequences of changes, to analyze them, and to integrate approved changes into the baseline. Variance analysis compares project execution results versus baseline estimates and does not focus exclusively on changes or help integrate changes into the baseline. The configuration management system tracks and archives versions of the scope baseline, from the initial project plan to every revision to the project baselines.
* **Implementation**. Project changes generally occur during the project implementation phase and not during the planning or closing stages of the project life cycle. Project monitoring and control processes highlight the impact of unmanaged changes.
* **Sustainability**. The five sequential steps in the popular Ad Car model for managing change are awareness of the need for change, desire to participate in and support the change, knowledge about how to change, ability to implement change, and behaviors and reinforcement to sustain the change.
* **A clear communication plan**. Leaders should be in constant communication with the entire organization. While creating the change management plan, include a communications plan as well. Use your communications to help facilitate a smooth transition any way you can, and finally expect the unexpected.
* **All levels - support is needed at all levels**. Communicate early and often, be in constant communication with the entire organization. Provide relevant, timely information, and encourage people to ask questions and share feedback. If one person has a question, others probably have it too.

### Change Management Process
Change management is a structured approach for ensuring that change initiatives are thoroughly and smoothly implemented and that the lasting benefits of change are achieved. 

The most important thing to recognize about change management is that it's all about people. **Organizations don't change, people do**. For a company to change, the employees have to learn new ways of doing their jobs. This requires successful personal transitions for the larger-scale change initiative to succeed.

Change management focuses on **preparing employees for change, supporting them through the change, and equipping them with the knowledge, skills, and tools to be successful**. 

#### The impact of change management is felt at these levels:
* Individual
* Organizational
* Enterprise

#### Individual change management 
It refers to employees and how they do their jobs. Change management at the individual level involves the psychology behind how people experience change. If individuals embrace new job roles, processes, or strategies, then the change initiative is poised for success. If individuals resist or refuse, the change initiative will most likely fail.

##### Questions that employees may have 
* Will these new people take my job? 
* Will I have to change my schedule? 
* Will I work in a different building? 

Not knowing the answers to these and other questions may cause fear and even hostility. 

The psychological aspect of individual change management includes understanding people's needs to help them accept and embrace a change initiative. These needs include frequent, relevant communication for business leaders and managers, targeted training before a change occurs, coaching to reinforce new skills and behaviors, and activities to ensure the changes become a permanent part of employees' daily routines. 

One way to mitigate resistance to change is to include employees and discussions and decisions about the tasks for which they are responsible. Encourage employees to offer suggestions, include them in the process from the beginning, and convey that you value their contributions. 

#### Organizational change management
It refers to change initiatives that affect groups and teams. Specifically, it's about how their processes work now and what must change so they can improve.

In organizational change initiatives, companies must certainly keep individual employees in mind, but these are larger-scale initiatives that may affect hundreds or even thousands of employees collectively. On approaching change management at the organizational level, the leaders of the initiative should create a plan customized for the groups affected. This is important because when one group changes its processes, those changes may create a ripple effect. The result is that other groups must change their processes as well. For change initiatives to be successful cross-functionally, groups must work together toward a common goal.

##### A customized change management plan should focus on
* Awareness of the change initiative
* Training opportunities
* Coaching
* Sustainability

The team leading the change initiative must communicate all process-related decisions, including who will train the third-party groups.

* Will current floor supervisors be reallocated to manage them? 
* When do the third-party groups begin taking calls? 
* Are the new groups for all overflow or only when call volume increases above a predetermined level? 
* Are they taking only basic first-level calls or being trained to handle more complex issues? 

The answers to these questions determine the range of the ripple effect throughout the call center groups.

#### Enterprise change management
It refers to change initiatives that affect the entire organization.

Business leaders typically launch enterprise change initiatives to meet new strategic objectives. These types of initiatives require a comprehensive change management process and typically take a **top-down approach**. In enterprise change management process, directives are applied consistently across an organization. Leaders and managers are equipped to lead their groups and teams effectively, and employees are empowered to ask for whatever resources they need to make the change initiative a success.

If the process is well executed, employees at all levels understand why the changes are needed, accept the changes, and quickly embrace the new ways of working. When this occurs, organizations can respond quickly and decisively to any opportunities or challenges that arise with minimal impact to service quality or productivity.

#### Common drivers of change initiatives, regardless of whether the focus is at the individual, organizational, or enterprise level
* technological advances
* process improvement initiatives
* internal or external crisis situations
* changes in consumer habits or behaviors
* increased competition

### Implement a Change Management Process
The importance of the change management process cannot be overstated when it comes to successfully implementing and navigating organizational change. 

#### Five stages of a change
* Concept
* Planning
* Definition and design
* Implementation
* Operation

#### Concept phase
Business leaders develop their vision for the change. Then they share the vision with management and work together to refine it. The leaders also assess the current state of the organization, perform an initial feasibility analysis, and make the decision to proceed to the next phase or reject the concept.

#### Planning phase
Business leaders consider the organization's target state and work to further refine the change concept. They also document the initial scope, schedule, and budget and conduct further feasibility analysis. If the change is deemed feasible, it moves on to the next phase.

The planning phase also includes the formation of a change management team, if one doesn't already exist, to develop and execute the change management plan.

#### Definition and design stage
The team leading the change initiative clarifies the scope and objectives for the effort along with the strategy for reaching the target state. They also **create plans and document the processes for scheduling, communicating, implementing, testing, and evaluating the change initiative**. The leadership team must be highly attuned to the company's culture and recognize that any change affects current processes and systems in some way. But most importantly, they must acknowledge the impact that change has on individuals and set the employees up for success.

#### Implementation phase
The change leaders execute the plans, monitor progress, and address any issues that arise. The team should continuously communicate about the status of the change initiative and respond to questions quickly.

#### Operation phase
The change initiative is complete, and the organization is operating in the target state. Progress is measured against the expected results, and the change ultimately becomes ingrained in the organization. It's critical to manage all change initiatives using an effective change management process. 

#### The ADKAR model for managing change
The model was developed by Prosci founder Jeff Hiatt.
Its focus is to prepare individual employees for change, guide them through the change, and by doing so, achieve both individual and organizational success. 

##### Five sequential steps in the ADKAR model 
* Awareness of the need for change.
* Desire to participate in and support the change.
* Knowledge about how to change.
* Ability to implement change.
* Behaviors and reinforcement to sustain the change. 

#### Other tools for managing change
* **Process mapping** to create a workflow diagram showing all steps in a process from beginning to end. When organizations map their processes, they gain knowledge about the current state of the business. They use process mapping at the beginning of a change initiative in the concept phase, and the maps are excellent communication tools to clarify understanding of current and target states. 

#### SWOT Analysis
A SWOT analysis is when an organization evaluates its
* Strengths
* Weaknesses
* Opportunities
* Threats

During a SWOT analysis, an organization identifies how to take advantage of its strengths and opportunities, minimize the impact of its weaknesses, and deal with threats. A SWOT analysis provides insight into an organization's current state but can also help shape the future state of the change initiative.

##### Stakeholder analysis
Organizations perform stakeholder analysis to gauge the attitudes and perspectives of the stakeholders who are part of a change initiative and determine how to manage and meet their expectations.

Stakeholder analysis should be done during the planning phase of the change process and several more times throughout the initiative to track changes in stakeholder attitudes. This analysis reveals which individuals are advocates or resistors of your change initiative.

##### Rediness assessment
The assessment is typically a custom design checklist that accounts for the current state of the organization and the requirements of the proposed change initiative. It also identifies any potential problems to address before launching the initiative.

##### Plans to manage a successful transition from the current state to the target state and beyond
These plans include strategic learning plans that identify training needs based on the target state. These plans should motivate and engage employees to adopt lasting change. Communication plans that outline what you need to share, how often, and with whom. Let your entire workforce know what is changing, the reason for the change, and how the change will affect individuals and groups. This is key. If employees don't understand why the change is happening, getting their buy-in becomes much more difficult.

##### Continuous improvement plans
To ensure the sustainability of a change initiative through continual review, evaluation, and action, business and change leaders recognize the importance of creating, executing, and refining these plans.  

They pay particular attention to the communication plan because they realize how important it is for employees to understand what's happening and why. Time spent mapping the faces of the change management process. Finding a change management model that keeps focus on the individual and identifying tools for your change management initiative is critical to setting your organization up for success.

#### Communicating for and managing change
Effective communication and active management of change can accelerate any process improvement effort through harnessing more of the local workforce, encouraging engagement, and increasing overall acceptance of the required change. 

#### Identify the need for communication 
Effective communication plays a vital role in persuading those resistant to change, and garnering the necessary support for a successful implementation.

Good communication convinces those who are resistant to change, creating the majority needed for change to proceed. Identifying the basic communication elements will help craft a consistent message that is likely to elicit the desired behavior and increase the change efforts likelihood of success. 

All change is difficult. Implementing change in organizations is even more difficult and cannot happen without the support of approximately ninety percent of the organization. 

Communication is essential before and during the process of change to increase the chance of success. It is also critical for the maintenance of change. Messaging should be aimed at those accepting of change so that they are informed and involved. Intense messaging should also be aimed at those skeptical of change to win their hearts and minds, creating new advocates for change. To address both groups, change agents must share a clear picture of the post-change future in terms that are appealing to each group. 

##### What are you trying to change to? 
* Defect-free processes
* Processes with reduced complexity
* Disciplined team oriented problem solving
* Common approach and Language
* Fact-based decisions
* Focus on the critical process inputs

Knowledge of the top barriers and success factors is a key element of the planning process.

##### Linking Current and Future/Target states "FROM" -> "TO"
* Compliance - Commitment
* Complexity - Simplicity
* Accetance of Error - Elimination of Error
* Weak Measures - Hard Measures
* Silos - Collaboration
* Impatience - Patience

##### Identifying Barriers and Success Factors

##### Top 10 Barriors
* Competing resources
* Functional Boundaries
* Change Skills
* Middle Management
* Long IT Lead Times
* Communication
* Employee Opposition
* HR (People/Training) Issues
* Initiative Fatigue
* Unrealistic Timetables

##### Top 10 Success Factors
* Ensuring Top Sponsorship
* Treating People Fairly
* Involving Employees
* Providing Quality Communications
* Providing Sufficient Training
* Usinf Clear Performance Measures
* Building Teams After Change
* Focusing on Culture/Skill Changes
* Rewarding Success
* Using Internal Champions

Change teams should take an honest look at the current shape of their change effort. Do their plans have more of the identified barriers or the success factors? Understanding the need for communication and basing it on a clear vision will elicit the desired behavior and reduce resistance to change, greatly enhancing a change efforts chances of success.

#### Create a communication plan
Regularly sharing information boosts engagement among those affected by the change and helps reduce resistance from others. The following video explains how to create a communication plan. 

The regular flow of information enhances engagement from many of the people impacted by the change and reduces the resistance to change by others. 

Change teams should begin with the end in mind. This is the basis of the communication plan. 

Create a description of the desired future state and the overall plan to attain that goal, bearing in mind the language and messaging required to meet each individual where he or she currently is. The following questions help define the objective for the change team:
* What key messages do we want to communicate? 
* What should be the standard forms of communication? 
* Who will own the communication process? 
* Who should the communication come from and go to? 
* What will be the best communication vehicles? 
* How frequently do we want to communicate? 
* Do we want to establish an initiative website? If so, what do we want it to convey? And how often will we update it? 
* What internal memorandums do we need to consider? What is the objective of these memorandums? What is the distribution list for these memorandums?

Single one-sized messaging is not the path to success for the communication plan. Bearing in mind that change, teams must plan to meet each individual where she or he currently is. A plan must be built to target specific and relevant messaging to all levels of the organization. 

To identify targets for messaging, the team should ask the following questions: 
* What do we want to convey to those directly impacted by the change? 
* What do we want to convey to leaders and others who will support the change? 
* What do we want to convey to those implementing the change? 
* What is in it for each individual to support the change? Answer this question at all levels, and
* What do we expect individuals to do differently from what they are doing now? Answer this question at all levels

Creating change takes alignment at all levels of the organization. To understand if a change is likely to be successful and sustainable, asking any employee about the rationale and benefits of the change should yield the same one to two-sentence answer. Shorter is always better.

To aid in the creation of messaging, change teams should ask the following questions:
* What are the Frequently Asked Questions? 
* What are the What's In It For Me (WIIFM) questions?
* What is the compelling message for the need to change? 

Change teams should use a variety of vehicles to ensure that all individuals in the organization receive the message. The adage tell them once and then tell them again is relevant.

Most adults need to receive a message **five to ten times** before it is absorbed. To choose the appropriate vehicles the change team should ask the following questions: 
* What media will be used? How do we determine which forms are suited for which audiences? At what stages of the change effort should they be used?
* Beyond the initialization, what regular communication can be put in place? Can articles in existing publications be used? Can we create a newsletter for our change effort? 
* What verbiage should be standard across the company? 
* Is it practical for senior leadership to do a publicity campaign to showcase commitment to the change effort?
* And communication should be a two-way effort. How can leaders interact with employees to verify that the messages are understood by all? 

Clearly, stating what actions should be exhibited by the members of the organization makes the result of communication campaigns measurable and serves as an indicator of success.

As a starting point, change teams can consider the chart of desired behaviors to help create messages appropriate for all levels of the organization. 

##### Chart of Desired Behavior
###### Targeat 1
* Operating Committee
* Steering Committee
* Corporate Deployment Office
* Functional VPs and Directors
* Manufacturing VPs and Directors
* Distribution VPs and Directors

###### Desired Behavior 1
* Communicate key concept of change effort
* Make the initiative relevant to employees
* Communicate this as a priority
* Request regular progress updates
* Facilitate success

###### Targeat 2
* Employees

###### Desired Behavior 2
* Understand rationale and benefits of change
* Be enthusiastic about opportunities for involvement and speak up
* Develop customer awareness

Determining **the key message**, **the target audience**, **the appropriate vehicles** for communication, and an overall owner for the effort will lay the foundation for a successful communication strategy.

### Set the stage for change
Awareness of successful drivers for change helps you to identify change opportunities. There are some key elements in any change effort that will prevent costly rework and negative perception by the target audience.

#### The successful change drivers are
* Accountability
* Adaptability
* Communication
* Focus, Purpose and Vision
* Involvement
* Leadership
* Measurement and results
* Momentum
* Readiness
* Recognition and Reward
* Skill development
* Team orientation

To ensure that change stands the best possibility of success, seven questions should be addressed by the change team. 
* Who will lead the change? Ensure that a strong champion sponsors the change and dedicates time to the change process.
* Why do we need to change? The need must be explained in terms that speak to each individual. The team should craft detailed and simple messages so that everyone can express the WIIFM. 
* What are we going to change to express the future state in clear WIIFM terms? 
* Who else is involved? Establish a strong network of supporters at all levels of the organization. 
* How is the organization aligned to support the change? Verify that systems and structures currently in place do not restrain the change. 
* How fast is the change going to be implemented? Install fixed benchmarks to measure and communicate progress. 
* How is the change going to be sustained? 

For a change to be successful, commitment is required from all of those involved. The change team can foster an environment to create commitment from all the stakeholders to embrace the change. Creating commitment is gaining meaningful support from those employees that must change in order to achieve the benefits of the proposed change and developing support from employees to help transform the business. Successful business change occurs when employees can choose how they engage the change. 

#### Choice and No-Choice change

#### No-Choise Change
##### Examples
* System-driven process change
* Temporary headcount reduction
* Changed organizational structure
* New meetings structure

##### Benefits
* Low, often superficial
* Compliance may be enough

##### Investment
* Low leadership investment
* Often high technical costs
* High cost of forcing change

#### Choise Change
##### Examples
* Improved customer service
* Sustained headcount reduction
* Cross functional cooperation
* Team working

##### Benefits
* High, fundamental change

##### Investment
High in terms of time, energy, and change leadership

Understanding change drivers and the seven key elements that need to be incorporated into any change effort allows for the creation of a successful change plan from early in the change effort’s lifespan.

### Overcome resistance to change
Resistance to change is always present, and understanding its normal life cycle permits the formulation of strategies to combat it. 

By acknowledging and addressing resistance, you can foster sustainable commitment, increasing the chances of the change effort's success. You just need to create the awareness that resistance is always present, and focus on the need to overcome it as part of a successful change effort. 

Stop, think for a moment about change in your personal life. 
* Is it always easy? 
* Are you always ready to accept the change? 
* Do you always implement suggested changes immediately? 

Human beings are often uncomfortable with change and will take steps to delay having to implement it. We label such behavior as resistance. Individuals resist change. Organizations resist change. 
* Change teams can cultivate change acceptance by addressing and providing support for as many of the levers as possible, such as:
* Goal clarity - I know what I want from this change. 
* Self-belief - I can get what I want out of this change. 
* Organization - I am clear about the steps to achieve it. 
* Flexibility - If I can't get it that way, I'll try another way. 
* Support network - I know who can help me with the change. 
* Action - I will take the necessary steps to achieve what I want. 
* Learning - I accept that change is a learning opportunity. 

Change teams must create and repeatedly communicate a compelling need at both the organizational and personal level in terms that are appropriate for each audience. How individuals resist and commit to change depends on whether they perceive a personal compelling need and the degree of personal choice available.

Change is more likely to last in an environment where individuals are free to choose and commit to the desired change in order to move the organization to the desired future state. Often it is better for change to be met with open resistance. That way the root causes can be discovered and addressed.

Change teams should not be lulled into a false sense of ease when change is met with initial enthusiasm. This often fades and turns to resistance as individuals begin to evaluate the impact on their environment and other elements of their lives that they hold dear. Messaging must occur at several points along the change journey to take this eventual fading of enthusiasm into account.

##### Messaging must occur at several points along the change journey to take this eventual fading of enthusiasm into account
* Enthusiasm
* Resistance
* Understanding
* Commitment

#### Two primary types of resistance
* Positive resistance. The individual is testing out the change to deepen his or her understanding and come to terms with its personal implications.
* Negative resistance. There is no component of working toward acceptance of change.

##### Examples of Positive Resistance
* Open-minded questioning
* Disagreeing with the solution
* Lobbying for alternative solutions
* Questioning the need
* Challenging the vision

##### Examples of Negative Resistance
* Not coming to meetings
* Being too busy to attend training
* Pulling key people out of workshops
* Questioning the budget
* Having a false initiative.

To build commitment among individuals and in the organization as a whole change teams should clearly communicate the vision and the compelling need for the change. 

iUnderstanding resistance and its usual progression will help address it head-on and move to building commitment from all stakeholders for the change effort.

### Change acceleration tools
There are a set of techniques and strategies that are used to drive successful change within an organization. These are called the change acceleration tools. These tools are designed to help leaders and teams understand, plan, and implement change in a way that maximizes adoption and minimizes resistance.

Change acceleration tools make the forces supporting and opposing the change visible to all stakeholders. Having a clear picture of these forces helps refine messaging and secure additional support, if necessary. 

Use of change acceleration tools allows the forces for and against the change effort to become visible to all stakeholders. With a clear shared picture of the forces for and against the change, the practitioner can refine the messaging and work to secure additional support if needed. Targeting key messages tailored to the appropriate audiences can elicit the desired support for change and increase the speed of change.

#### The stakeholder analysis tool
The stakeholder analysis tool identifies key stakeholders, classifies how stakeholders feel about 
* The change effort
* Measures stakeholders’ level of support for the change effort
* Serves as a starting point to target messaging to meet stakeholders where they are today and to take them where we want them to go. 

Collaboration yields different prospects, which are the keys for accurate representation of the stakeholder's beliefs and attitudes. Ideally, change teams develop this analysis in one meeting and revisit it at least once before using it as a basis for communication.

To have a clear picture of the change team's ability and attitude toward creating change, it must be measured. This is done before proceeding with the change effort. It is best to allow team members to initially answer in writing as to not influence others.

#### The change mapping tool 
The change mapping tool helps to identify the team's understanding of the change through a series of questions. Ask change mapping tool questions in this sequence:
* Who has to change?
* Who authorizes that change? Is he or she a change target too?
* Who authorizes that change?
* Who can influence the change targets or change leaders?
* Who has a contract with the change leader to achieve change?
* Does anyone else have a role?
* Are key relationships likely to be productive? Do they have shared goals? Do they need each other?
* And what tactics will improve the chances of success for the best results?

For the best results, schedule adequate time for the responses to gather answers and to understand the answers. This can take between four and eight hours, depending on the change complexity, and the number of team members. The data and ideas generated in this exercise can be used in **the force field analysis** and **change acceleration profile** tools, which make concepts more visual and accessible.

#### The force field analysis tool
The force field analysis tool identifies the effecting change and uses this knowledge to refine change communication. The force field analysis tool identifies those forces supportive of change, enablers, identifies those forces resistant to change, restrainers, identifies the team's perceived balance between enablers and restrainers, and is evaluated for an entire change effort or for single change elements.

#### The force field analysis tool
The force field analysis tool be used by a team and not by an individual to garner the most robust results. It is best to allow team members to initially come up with enablers and restrainers so as not to influence or stifle their contributions. This tool describes a single point in time, usually the present. As such, it is important to update the tool on a regular basis. This is usually done after each significant milestone in the change effort.

#### The change acceleration profile tool 
The change acceleration profile tool helps to assess the current state of the team along seven key change acceleration elements:
* Leading change
* Creating need
* Shaping vision
* Mobilizing commitment
* Using levers
* Monitoring progress, and
* Making it last

Team members fill out a profile on how things get done in the organization. Based on the answers, each of the seven change elements is measured and displayed on a graph. If there is one strong score in each of the three zones, the team is ready for change.

The change process accelerates using the change acceleration tools because the forces for and against change become visible, driving common understanding and adjustments to the change effort where needed.

Individuals do not expend the energy required for change day in and day out unless they find value in **the future state**. Change in organizations follows the same process, but the challenges are far greater given the need to convince multiple individuals through targeted messages of the value in **the future state**. 

### Key factors for a successful change initiative
These six key factors contribute to a successful change initiative:
* Develop a formal change management process.
* Attune to the organization’s culture constantly.
* Make a formal case for the change initiative.
* Assign leadership roles to dedicated, motivated, and visible individuals.
* Communicate with the organization constantly.
* Expect the unexpected.

#### Develop a formal change management process.
Develop a formal change management process for the organization. Develop your process **early**, not on the fly, while attempting a change initiative and continually review the process to determine what works and what needs improvement. Ensure the process is fully integrated and followed, beginning with the business leaders, introducing the change concept, and continuing as the initiative moves through the enterprise. 

#### Attune to the organization’s culture constantly.
When conceptualizing a change initiative and creating a vision for the target state, understanding the cultural landscape is key. Assessing culture identifies for leaders, the organization's readiness for change, 
* What problems are internal conflicts may be lurking just below the surface? 
* Where to look for leaders and champions? 
* And where the greatest resistance lies?

#### Make a formal case for the change initiative.
Craft a formal written statement making points: 
* How big of a change to expect?
* Who the change affects? 
* What it means for them personally?
* and if it's really what's best for the company. 

State the need for the change, be specific, and be real, for example, to maintain standard shift length and service level agreements during natural disasters. 

Assure people that the change gives the company a viable future. Assure people that the business leaders will achieve that future. Give them a road map sharing at a high level how the company will get from here to there. 

Create different versions of this message customized for different audiences, which doesn't mean tell one group one story and another group a different one.

#### Assign leadership roles to dedicated, motivated, and visible individuals.
This means to scour the organization and pluck these people from every level. These leaders form the guiding coalition from Kotter's eight-step model for leading change and from this group. You'll identify the change champions. This group takes ownership of the change initiative. These people are knowledgeable and respected. They're influencers. 

##### Kotter's 8-step Model
1. Create urgency.
2. Build a guiding coalition.
3. Create a vision for change.
4. Enlist a volunteer army.
5. Enable action.
6. Generate short-term wins.
7. Sustain acceleration.
8. Institute change.

#### Communicate with the organization constantly.
Provide relevant, timely information and encourage people to ask questions and share feedback. 

#### Expect the unexpected.
Throughout the entire change process, the change leaders must continuously review and evaluate progress. And when problems arise, they must act quickly to remove the impediment and put the initiative back on track. How the team deals with this is outlined in the continuous improvement plan. Simply by being prepared for challenges, whatever their nature, you increase the likelihood of success.

Always take a people-centric approach to change management and get ready to experience success and achieve your strategic goals.

### Impact of change
Change can be unsettling, positive, exciting, or even scary. Identifying the effects of **short-term** and **long-term** change and recognizing the various stages people go through as they respond to change is crucial to the success of the team. 

Whether positive or negative, most people respond to change in a series of stages and in predictable ways. One should therefore understand the potential short-term and long-term impacts of change on a person's life.

#### Stages in responding to change
1. **Surprise**. We might say I did not expect that now.
2. **Refuse**. We may refuse to believe the change will affect us. Or we may believe it will affect us for a short time, but its effects will lack staying power and fade away over time. 
3. **Eesentment**. We may resent that the change is happening to us after all we have been through. We may express this resentment with statements such as things are working fine, “Why do we have to change now?”
4. **Adjustment**. We may adjust to the change grudgingly, since it looks like it's not going away.
5. **Agreement**. We may agree that this change will be worthwhile and more important, we may determine how we can benefit from the change in tangible ways.

#### Short-term effects
People often react strongly to unwelcome change. They may express strong negative feelings because of 
* **fear**,
* **anxiety**,
* **resistance**, 
* or **denial**. 

These feelings may translate into counterproductive behaviors, such as being overly aggressive, nasty, uncooperative, or uncommunicative. Counterproductive behaviors also may take the form of overwork or procrastination. On a personal level, your health may suffer if you engage in drug use, excessive use of alcohol, do not get enough sleep, eat improperly, fail to exercise regularly or cut yourself off from friends and family.

Change sometimes has the immediate effect of outright resistance, such as blatant refusal to follow a new procedure, or a more passive-aggressive approach, such as when people sit in meetings with their arms folded and do not participate in discussions.

Alternatively, some people may take a rigid approach to dealing with change because it disrupts their comfort level, and so their instinct is to strongly resist it due to internal fears that they may not have the skills or abilities to be effective in their new environment.

#### Long-term effects
If you are unable to deal with, resist and ignore change, you will limit your ability to grow and develop as a human being. You will also add a significant degree of frustration to your existence, which may lead to unhappiness. You may become stagnant and live your life with many limitations while seeing your colleagues and friends growing and developing in both their work and family life. Such behavior and experience puts you at higher risk for illness as the frustration and resulting stress compromise your immune system and lack of focus causes you to be at risk for a major injury. 

Change can affect a person in both the long and short term.

Change, especially major change such as a plant closing or a serious illness, can be upsetting. Whether positive or negative, most people respond to change in a series of stages and in predictable ways. 

### Knowledge Check
* **Scope**. Project changes affect the baseline constraint of project scope. The company’s organization structure and project configuration are not project baselines.
* **Inaccurate estimates**. Inaccurate estimates are internal change drivers. New regulations and economic downturn are external change drivers.
* **Concept**. Concept is the first phase of change management process. Business leaders develop their vision for the change and share the vision with management and work together to refine it.
* **Stakeholder analysis**. Organizations perform stakeholder analysis to gauge the attitudes and perspectives of the stakeholders who are part of a change initiative and determine how to manage and meet their expectations.

Stakeholder analysis should be done during the planning phase of the change process and several more times throughout the initiative to track changes in stakeholder attitudes. This analysis reveals which individuals are advocates or resistors of your change initiative.

* **Both individual and the organization**. To increase the probability of change success, change teams need to create a compelling need for change from the perspective of both individual and the organization.

### Summary
* Change management is a structured approach to ensure that change initiatives are thoroughly and smoothly implemented, and that the lasting benefits of change are achieved. 
* The change management process consists of concept, planning, definition and design, implementation, and operation phases.
* Identifying the effects of short-term and long-term change and recognizing the various stages people go through as they respond to change is crucial to the success of the team. 

## General Tips for Successful Project Management
### Pre-assessment
* **Helps the team share an unexpected problem and its possible solution**. Creating a highly competitive environment or recognizing only the best performers of the team does not come under the scope of a communication plan. A communication plan ensures collaboration among team members by helping the team to share an unexpected problem and its possible solution.
* **Survey**. An internal survey will help to isolate when communications have been ineffective or when they have lacked clarity, leading to misinterpretation. A conversation, message, or memo is insufficient to find where communications have been ineffective. An internal survey is necessary.
* **Project management technology**. Coordination technology, conferencing, and communication do not have features such as costing and budgeting, assigning individual task work functions, and achieving team goals and milestones. These are features of project management technology.
* **Are not early adopters**. Human beings can be resistant to new technology because they are not early adaptors. This resistance is not because they are open to newness, do not have habitual behavior, or are comfortable with exposure.
* **Monetary incentives**. Monetary incentives are not a critical part of the definition of a team. In fact, monetary incentives potentially could detract from effective team functioning if not used properly.

A team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach, for which they hold themselves mutually accountable. This definition applies equally well to colocated and virtual teams.

### Effective Communication Strategies
Effective communication strategies contribute significantly to project efficiency, adaptability, and the achievement of desired outcomes. 

A communication plan keeps project stakeholders and teams aligned throughout the course of the project. It addresses different ways of communicating with team members, across different types of stakeholders, by using appropriate communication mediums and channels. 
#### Reasons for using a communication plan
In a perfect world, you could orchestrate any project or function flawlessly from the start. You could define all **responsibilities**, **deliverables**, and **timelines** of the project at the outset. However, the planning process for any project has many **uncertainties**, **unpredictable events**, and **dependencies** that occur in real-time. 

When a collective project is conceived, its strength is not necessarily derived from its **size** or **scope**, but rather from its ability to function as an **integrated whole**, coordinated through a detailed communication plan, while planning the responsibilities of individuals involved in a project or business function is essential. 

A communication plan is an essential reality check for understanding the definition and scope of a project. It also aids the team members in understanding their responsibilities and helps them tackle unexpected problems and explore possible solutions.

Communication plans also help manage scope and foster collaboration on the team, while focusing team members on the project goals and objectives. 

The knowledge sharing that occurs in interdependent activities ensures that the significant efforts of all participants align toward achieving the common agenda and informs other collaborators that the responsibility of each individual is an integral part of the entire project. Through repeated communications, this process helps instill a shared vision and the teamwork required for its realization.

Teamwork is crucial for any business as it requires the participants to perform the individual responsibilities of their assigned roles and understand how their work fits into the larger process. With a communication plan that documents reporting responsibilities, participants understand the overall goals and integrity of a project.

The project manager developing a communication plan will better understand the interrelationships. The communication plan is also an essential reality check for understanding the **definition** and **scope** of a project.

One primary purpose of developing a communication plan is to look for the most efficient way to accomplish your goals. While it may be beneficial initially to include all possible communications to make during a project or across a function, focusing on a more efficient communication plan allows you to examine the utility of your original prescriptions. 

Streamlining your plan frees up valuable time and effort of participants who would otherwise send and respond to unnecessary messages and attend meetings outside their areas of responsibility. 

Performing project communication is more than just executing a plan. It is an ongoing responsibility of each member of the project team to collect information, document it, and respond or forward it when needed. Making an effective plan that records communications adds value to already developed project documentation requirements and may often reduce the project documentation workload. 

Organizing and archiving planned communications can serve as an essential ingredient of the project documentation. By indicating the informational inputs that were available and incorporated during each decision-making process of the project. The result should be members who are well-informed, trained, and motivated about their role in achieving business objectives, especially if your project includes significant changes to current operations.

Without the focus of participant buy-in, your communication plan will at best leave the team disconnected and at worst dismissive or cynical. Buy-in is easiest to achieve when all internal participants have had a role in developing the communications plan. This practice imparts accountability when participants feel a level of ownership for the communication responsibilities, engaging participants listening to feedback.

#### Essentials of a communication plan
The first step to develop a successful communication plan is to establish the project goals and objectives with as much specificity as possible. 

The essentials of a communication plan answer the following questions.
* Why? What information should be communicated? The objective of the communication.
* WWho? Who should receive that information? You need to identify the appropriate sender and recipient of the information.
* When? When should that information be delivered? When answers the timing of your communication.
* What? Where will the information be shared? You should know the substance and form to be conveyed.
* How? How will the communication be tracked and analyzed by the team? What channel to employ, and when answers the timing of your communication. 

##### Communication Objective
The objective must state the reason the sender and receiver should take time and make an effort to communicate.

A communication plan with a clear objective allows employees to feel valued as an important part to higher levels of performance and better business results. 

##### The sender and receiver of the communication
The objective of a communication plan helps to determine the sender and receiver of the communication. 

##### The purpose of the communication plan
The purpose of the communication plan determines both the **content** and the **form** of your planned communications. It is important to design the content of the message to meet the objective of the communication plan. 

For example, if the objective is to inform the receiver when to begin a particular task, then the key messages must contain information regarding time and certainty. 

In addition, it is important for you to have a limited number of ideas to deliver. If you try to deliver more than two or three concepts in your communication, the recipient may lose focus and ultimately may not hear any of the messages. Therefore, the content of the message should also be **concise** and **compelling**. 

If any element of persuasion exists in the communication, support it with two to four key support points including easily understood facts, figures, and examples. Similarly, the form of the communication also depends on the objective of the communication plan. 

##### Communication channels
The consideration of the channels through which your recipients are accustomed to receiving information is particularly critical to reach your desired external audiences. 

##### Time of communication
Receiving a communication is an active and time-committing activity. It takes time and effort to move away from current activities, give the proper attention to your message, and then refocus on other activities. It is sometimes better to package communications in **bundles**. 

Audience-centric approach is important. Each communication is in competition for attention with the other messages your targeted audience receives. If you are planning internal communications, it is best to ask your recipients what time is best.

iExternally, you should be cognizant of times of the day, week, or year when your intended audience is overwhelmed with other communications or periods of intense activity. 

To gain the benefit of an effective communication strategy, you must describe each communication with as much specificity as possible. It is best to do this by answering who, what, when, where, and why. In addition, the content, form, selection of appropriate communication channels, and timing of your communication play a significant role when implementing the communication strategy.

#### Objective of a communication plan
The objective of a communication plan helps to determine the sender and receiver of the communication. Let's dive deeper into the different objectives of a communication plan.

##### Communication to implement a project
If the objective of a communication plan is to help implement a project, then the sender is usually the person who is closest to the information source, while the receiver is the person who needs to know how to proceed with the project. Apart from these recipients, other people are not directly affected by the information. 

##### Communication to inform others of the effects of a project
If the objective of communication is to inform others of the ultimate effect of the project, then it becomes an issue of change management. In general, studies show that people prefer to hear from two people in this circumstance.
1. The sponsor of the change who can talk about the business issues and reasons for change.
2. Their immediate supervisor who can talk about the personal impact of the change. 

##### Communication to reach the external stakeholders
If a communication needs to reach outside the organization to a broader audience, a great deal of thought and research is required. 
* If it is a marketing communication, it is important to determine and inform the target market. 
* If it is a regulatory communication, it is important to determine who else besides the authority can and should see the information. 
* If it is a press release about executive changes, it is important to determine how broad the distribution is depending on the level of seniority. 

These issues are challenging to formulate and require attention on an individual basis.

#### Effective monitoring of a communication plan
Before putting the communication plan into action, the plan has most likely gone through several revisions. Usually, the revisions occur in a haphazard fashion, as any one party recognizes the need for change. You should review the plan in a group meeting, assessing all its elements and outcomes. Change the plan as necessary and, then identify the effect of external activities such as **organizational**, **strategic** and **competitor** changes. 

This meeting is also the time to examine overriding issues such as **budget**, **feasibility**, and **manageability** that are not accessible until plan completion. 

or example, you must determine whether you have allocated sufficient time in the plan for each review. Finally, stakeholders within the larger organization must review and approve the plan. This process includes affected lateral groups, as well as senior executives who have a stake in the project or function. The most effective means to evaluate a communication plan is to view it from the same perspective you used to develop the plan. 

##### The most common mistakes in a communication plan
* Unrealistic objectives
* The wrong audience
* An unclear message
* The wrong timing
* Poor delivery

While the overall effect of a communication plan is difficult to measure since so many variables are a part of the desired effect, you can specifically develop criteria that should start with questioning the intended audience, were the recipients affected in the expected way, were the recipients properly identified as the correct recipients, was the message clear? was the message received at the right time to be helpful, and was the message received through the appropriate channel? 

Your monitoring should involve routine audits to review, spot, and aggregate e-mail traffic to determine whether the quality and overall volume of e-mail communications matches the original plan. 

Audits can also uncover other potential holes in project information plans, such as team members who neglect to journal casual conversations and phone calls, or stakeholders who use personal e-mail accounts for work discussions.

You should also actively monitor traditional and electronic media to measure and adapt to unforeseen effects of a public communications program. 

Communication is an ongoing activity. The purpose, audience, message timing, and channels may change, but the need to maintain communications remains. Therefore, an important part of any communication plan is to revise it continuously based on your experience. Maintaining flexibility around a communications plan is one of the best ways to stay focused on the plan’s ultimate goal of keeping the project, function, or organization operating smoothly.

Strict adherence to one particular type, form, or style of communication can be limiting and frustrating for managers and team members. 

For example, stakeholders may prefer **webcasts** to **newsletters** for communication, so they can use tools that convert text to speech. Likewise, you can convert discussion boards and other tools to e-mail for the benefit of participants who like to organize their communications within their e-mail. 

The process of monitoring your plan includes a series of reviews with team members before the plan begins. Monitoring criteria such as audience satisfaction with messages they receive, auditing e-mail and web-based traffic, and making continual revisions as circumstances dictate, you will gain valuable experience from the iterative nature of the communication plan.

#### Communication plan review and revision
For a communication plan to serve its purpose, it needs buy-in from all stakeholders. Reviewing and revising the communication plan during the course of its implementation impacts the sense of **ownership** and **buy-in** from the project stakeholders. 

While managing a communication plan is one of the most important aspects of project and functional management, you must do this with a sense of balance between the optimal set of communications and the constraints of time and resources. Prior to the launch of the communication plan, you must review and revise the plan. 

With these considerations in mind, it is best to start by examining the **feasibility** of your plan, then move on to its **breadth** and **depth**. And finally, ensure that there is full commitment to the final plan by all the parties. This is because the planning process is most concerned with full coverage rather than constraints. 

##### The feasibility study
To determine the overall viability of the communication plan, it is essential to conduct a feasibility study. The fundamental purpose of the feasibility study is to discover any issues that may have developed beyond the intended resources or purpose of the plan. You must closely re-examine certain areas, such as considering if any of the requirements demand additional technology or other capabilities beyond current resources.

Overly burdensome requirements also deserve focus. 

Communications that extend upward in the management chain should be especially scrutinized for purpose and necessity. 

The purpose of the communication falls into three categories:
* **Executive-** requiring action, for example, telling the sales team to begin prospecting for suitable clients who fulfill the criteria developed by the data team. 
* **Informative-** requiring awareness, for example, telling the data team that its criteria yielded two suitable prospects in the Northeast and 
* **Deliberative-** requiring a decision, for example, the national sales manager must decide which of these clients to focus on first.

To cover the full scope, you should make sure that all the expected actions have the necessary communication to initiate them, all the involved internal and external parties are informed, and all the decisions that need to be made receive all the necessary informational inputs. Other purposes of business communications such as **persuasion**, **advisory**, and **morale** are typically not a part of the functional needs of the communication plan. As they are either ad hoc or opportunistic. 

While it is important to cover the full scope of communication needs in your plan, your review should also ensure efficient communication.

Distraction from the main issue and intent of the communication is confusion and frustration for the receivers who are trying to decipher why they are being given an irrelevant piece of information.

Another consideration regarding the level of detail is the audience. Often, the same subject of a communication may demand two different levels of detail depending on the receiver. 

Your communication plan also needs the acceptance and support of all the participants. Therefore, your review must include a final agreement among all participants that the plan is indeed feasible, complete, and efficient. 

People are more apt to follow your plan when they understand the reasons behind it. Having agreed to the plan's overall logic, participants will hold themselves more accountable for each of their responsibilities. 

A successful communication plan must be practical, comprehensive, and efficient, and most importantly, it should have the full commitment of all participants.

#### Facilitate communication plan feedback
As a project or function matures, additional types of communication activities may become necessary, and previously accomplished activities may need revision or elimination. Many of these decisions will be based on feedback from communication recipients to determine whether information is truly being delivered effectively and with the desired results.

It is important that what you believe you are communicating is identical to how your messages are being perceived. This section talks about how to use feedback as a tool to gain insight about the impact of your communications plan in achieving the overall project goals and objectives. 

Here are some ways to gather feedback on your communication plan: 
* Internal surveys. Help to isolate when communications have been ineffective or when they have lacked clarity leading to misinterpretation. The surveys can be **Quantitative** or **Qualitative**.
* External consultants. Can sometimes bring a **fresh** and **less biased** viewpoint of your strengths and weaknesses. Another reason is that honest feedback from employees is sometimes difficult to engineer due to fear of **judgment** or **recrimination**.
* Outreach programs. Essential to solidify and expand your relationships with your audience and enhance your feedback efforts. The recipients to whom you reach out should be highly targeted for both their impact on the project or function and for their ability to provide insight.

It is vitally important that what you believe you are communicating is identical to how your messages are being perceived. By obtaining feedback through surveys, the use of consultants, and an outreach program. You can gain true insight as to the effectiveness of your communications and whether they are having your desired effect.

### Team Environment and Collaboration Techniques
In a collaborative team environment, multiple individuals actively participate and collaborate to efficiently accomplish tasks and objectives. 

#### Dynamics of virtual teams
Virtual work relies on collaborative relationships and trust created using digital communication technology. Due to their structure, virtual teams face complexities related to time-zone differences, language differences, and the absence of social relationships.

The time and energy that virtual team leaders and team members invest in building the team are critical to overcome the forces that can disintegrate virtual teams. 

##### Team definition by Katzenbach and Smith in their book "The Wisdom of Teams" 
A **team** is a small number of people, ideally **five to seven** members with complementary skills, who are committed to a **common purpose**, **performance goals**, and **approach** for which they hold themselves mutually accountable. 

A **virtual team**, in addition, consists of members who are **dispersed across distance and time**, who are **linked together by technology**, and who **interact with each other in person rarely if at all**.

##### Factors that contribute to the complexity of a team
* Teams that rarely or never meet face-to-face are more complex than teams that are able to occasionally meet and get to know one another in person.
* The greater the time zone differences among team members, the greater the complexity. Imagine scheduling meetings when team members’ normal work hours do not overlap.
* A virtual team is more complex if members belong to two or more national cultures, two or more different companies, or two or more functions, or professional disciplines.

These factors **enhance team diversity**, which **stimulates creativity** but also **creates the potential for unnecessary conflict**.

If team members split their time working on other teams or frequently change their team memberships, team complexity also increases. Not all virtual teams are equally complex. 

##### Five major factors to manage effectively throughout the life of the team in order to achieve high performance
* **Roles**. Roles involve everyone on the team knowing their own and other team members' responsibilities so that everything gets done without duplication. 
* **Procedures**. Procedures involve everyone on the team following common approaches to activities such as team meetings, decision  making, and managing conflict.
* **Relationships**. Relationships involve everyone on the team trusting each other to tell the truth, follow through on commitments, and support the team inside and outside of team meetings.
* **Goals**. Goals involve everyone on the team understanding and committing to the overall purpose of the team, as well as to the specific objectives of each team member.
* **Environment**. Environment involves everything outside the team that might affect the performance of the team. For example, the environment includes external factors such as new products or services released by competitors as well as internal factors such as changes in your company's strategy.

##### The challenge for a virtual team is greater for three main reasons
1. In co-located teams, team members share the same business, cultural, and historical environment as the backdrop for their work. In virtual teams, members live and work in different environments and do not start with a common framework for working together. 
2. In co-located teams face-to-face interaction which allows team members to more clearly communicate about tasks. In virtual teams, the reliance on technology makes communication about critical tasks more challenging, largely due to the absence of important nonverbal cues. 
3. In co-located teams, social relationships and trust develop naturally as a result of frequent casual interaction that happens when people work in the same office. In virtual teams, social relationships and trust develop more slowly in the absence of casual interaction.

##### Virtual team dynamics - significant centrifugal forces
In a virtual team, there are significant centrifugal forces that can cause the team to spin apart and disintegrate. 

##### The strongest forces that tend to spin virtual teams apart by research by Kerber and Buono in their article, "Leadership Challenges in Global Virtual Teams"
* The pressure to pursue local priorities rather than those of the virtual team.
* The lack of face-to-face contact with fellow team members.
* National cultural differences.
* Time zone differences.

In order for a virtual team to achieve high performance the team leader must create integrating forces that pull the team back together.

The manager of a virtual team must continually supply the energy to counter the forces of disintegration.

##### Duarte and Snyder in their book, "Mastering Virtual Teams"
The virtual team leader often serves as the glue that holds the virtual team together in the face of disintegrating forces that can drive the team apart. 

In other words, virtual teamwork requires more management attention than co-located teamwork if the team is to achieve high performance.

To be successful, virtual team members must **take the initiative to communicate effectively**, **structure their own work time**, **manage priorities**, and occasionally **act independently** because they cannot count on the immediate support of others. Achieving team success depends on the active involvement of each team member.

A virtual team experiences all the typically encountered team challenges but also has its own unique challenges. The virtual team manager, in collaboration with all the members of the team, must manage the same factors that lead to high performance on any team while also realizing that there are additional forces that can disintegrate a virtual team if not countered by investing time and energy to effectively manage them.

#### Challenges in the management of virtual teams
##### Co-located teams
In co-located teams, team members share 
* the same physical, 
* the same business, 
* the same cultural, 
* and the same historical environment which form the backdrop for their work. 

##### Virtual teams
In virtual teams, team members that live and work in different environments cannot take for granted that other team members share their contextual knowledge, and cannot assume that they have a common framework for working together. 

Therefore, in order to achieve high performance, you need to help team members make the multiple contexts of the team explicit and appreciate the effects of those differences in the business environment on a team functioning.

##### Managing time zone differences
In order to effectively manage time zone differences, you should plot the location of all team members on a world map and distribute it to everyone. Communicate the appropriate time zone for each team member, when scheduling a meeting. **Rotate meeting times** so that no single location always has the difficult meeting time. 

Communicate an important message during the recipient's normal business hours, if possible. 

Be precise about what you want and when you need it, if you do not ask for the right information at the right time, the team may fall a day behind in getting something done, and decide about e-mail and voicemail response times as a team, for example, we will respond to fellow team members within twelve hours.

##### Native and non-native English speakers
Listen for language shortcuts. For example, if a team member says, "You hit the nail on the head." Ask the person to explain what they really mean. 

##### Different business practices
On a virtual team, team members may live in different countries, work at different companies, and have responsibilities in different functions. As a result, team members may differ significantly in the way they get their work done. These differences often cause confusion or even a lack of trust among team members, unless you help the team openly address these differences in business practices.

Different work functions often have divergent business objectives, and these differences should be considered when defining team goals. In light of different business practices across members of your team, be willing to adopt practices other than your own as the team norm. 

Frequently ask each team member, what has changed in your part of the world that might affect the work of our team.

##### Direct and indirect speaking cultures
People from direct speaking cultures value concise messages that confront difficulties openly. 

In contrast, people from indirect speaking cultures value the way a message is stated, and tend to speak subtly about difficult topics. 

When working with direct speaking team members, you should get right to the business at hand. The task is most important, then the relationship. State your point quickly and concisely, confront difficulties openly and do not assume that direct speakers will understand subtle messages, and do not take criticism too personally, direct speakers are just being truthful.

When working with indirect speaking team members, you should take time to check in about the relationship before shifting the conversation to the business at hand. The relationship is most important, then the task. Be patient and ask questions, allowing time for indirect speakers to get to their main point. Pay attention to subtle and especially nonverbal communication, because indirect speakers often avoid stating or understate their point, and use collaboration tools that allow for anonymous contributions.

##### View status differences
* **Egalitarian cultures** believe that everyone should be treated with the same level of respect.
* **Hierarchical cultures** believe that people in positions of authority should be treated with greater formality and deference.

When working with egalitarian team members, you should keep in mind that team members, at all levels, expect to be involved in decisions, at least as advisors, expect to be empowered to get the job done as they see fit based on their experience and expertise, and want to contribute to meetings regardless of who is present. 

When working with hierarchical team members, you should keep in mind that, asking for too much input from lower ranking team members may make you as the team manager appear less effective. Attempts to empower team members may be disruptive because it is expected that the manager makes the rules, and meetings should be held with employees of similar rank. If this is not the case, then lower ranking employees do not expect to participate. You may need to encourage participation without insisting on it, perhaps arranging for anonymous contributions.

Differences across the environments in which team members live and work can cause unnecessary conflict on your virtual team, unless you recognize and address those differences.

#### Member participation and collaboration governance structure
To meet your innovation strategic objectives, there are four models for collaboration to maximize human capital coupled with recommended technology tools.

There is a risk of falling behind while feeding your innovation pipeline with **new technologies, designs, products, or services**. To avoid this risk, leaders must honestly answer two fundamental questions related to their innovation projects:
* Should membership in a network be opened or closed?
* Should the collaborative governance structure for selecting problems and solutions be flat or hierarchical? 

When deciding on the membership of a collaborative governance structure, there are different levels of openness for participation. 
1.1. **A fully open participation network** allows everyone to participate, including **ssuppliers, customers, designers, inventors, research institutions, students, hobbyists, and competitors**.
1.2. **A fully closed participation network** allows participation by invitation.
2.1. **A fully hierarchical governance structure**. Team and individual decisions are controlled.
2.2. **A fully flat governance structure**. All team members are equal partners and share the decisions.

Answering the questions on membership and governance structure reveals the framework of the four basic collaborative models for innovation. 

#### Four Models for Collaboration to optimize the utilization of human capital 
1. **Innovation mall: open and hierarchical collaborative approach**.

An **innovation mall or crowdsourcing** is the leveraging of many participants to efficiently complete tasks which otherwise could not be economically completed within an expected time frame. It has open participation and hierarchical governance. 

In this open and hierarchical collaborative approach, the results typically benefit the initiator without significantly compensating the participants. They are open for anyone to contribute ideas and solutions, but the decision to pick the problem and its best solution is controlled by the company creators, thus making the structure hierarchical. 
2. **Elite circle: closed and hierarchical collaborative approach**.

An elite circle is a traditional **think tank** consisting of carefully chosen participants. However, the initiator has full control over the innovation lifecycle right from problem definition to selecting and implementing the solutions. It has closed participation and hierarchical governance.

In this approach, only an elite membership can share in the rewards.

3. **Open source: open and flat collaborative approach**.

Open source is where a community of participants come together for a collective mutual benefit and remain coequal or flat stakeholders. It has open participation and flat governance. 

In this approach, no single community member can exploit the other, and they share in the reward. Members of this collaboration community benefit from each other by mutually sharing each other’s investment in the application or product. 

4. **Consortium: closed and flat collaborative approach**.

A consortium is a private group of collaborators. They have more freedom in the decision-making processes throughout the innovation life cycle. It has a closed participation and flat governance. 

In this approach, collaborating members share in the rewards and are empowered to make decisions. 

#### An Innovation Mall and Open Source approach
Enablers for an innovation mall and open source approach are understanding your market, and having a secure technological architecture that allows outsiders to contribute easily, while still having the control to integrate within your organization. Also required is the ability to test and screen solutions at a low cost. 

#### Elite Circle
The enablers for an elite circle are understanding your market and having a secure technological architecture for the carefully chosen private contributors to participate easily, while at the same time retaining the control to integrate within your organization. The ability to find and build a unique relationship with contributors is also required.

#### Consortium
The enablers for a consortium are to have internal processes and rules and the capability to find and build a unique relationship with the carefully chosen contributors. These allow the contributors to achieve a common goal. 

#### Models advantages
**The innovation mall** and **open source approaches** are both geared toward a **large crowd** where feedback and ideas are collected from a larger community, whereas **the elite circle** and **consortium approaches** gather information and feedback from **smaller**, more select communities. 

#### Models challenges
The challenges to the innovation mall and open source approaches are trusting that the problem and strategic innovation go in the right direction and map with the organization's requirements, and the ability to acquire the capability to screen ideas, which may be as many as one-hundred daily.

Another challenge for the open source approach is getting contributors to converge on a solution in a timely manner, and that meets the organization's targets and goals.

Similarly, one of the challenges for an elite circle, is to trust that the problem and strategic innovation goes in the right direction and maps with the organization's requirements. 

A challenge for a consortium is getting private contributors to converge on a timely solution that meets the organization's targets and goals.

Another challenge to both the elite circle and consortium approaches, is identifying and recruiting the experts with the right knowledge within the budget.

When an organization or a project team embarks on an innovation project, it should realize that its current collaborative method or approach may not be optimal for what it is trying to achieve. One traditional collaborative approach for an elite circle is one where the collaborative approach is closed to private individuals and all decisions are controlled within the group. There are three other collaborative approaches an organization or a project team can leverage from, including the innovation mall, which is open to all but has a hierarchical governance, open source, which is open to all but has a flat governance, and the consortium approach where membership is private with a flat governance.


### Advantages of collaboration models and related approaches
#### Large crowd approach
The advantage of the innovation mall model is control over the direction of the innovation, and leaders can have a clear understanding of the relevant requirements, technologies, and customers.

The advantage of the open source model is that the burden and work effort are shared among the membership. Since this approach is flat, the organizations share the costs, risks, and technological issues with each other.

For both the innovation mall and open source models, being open to a large community offers the advantage of a broad range of interesting ideas.

#### Select community approach
The advantage of an elite circle model is that you can control the direction of innovation with the experts. Leaders have a clear understanding of the relevant requirements, technologies, and customers.

For both the elite circle and consortium models, you have knowledge domain experts who can deliver a better solution than with open participation.

### Human attributes necessary for collaboration
Organizations need to provide both **financial and nonfinancial incentives** to innovate and nurture various soft skills for collaboration. Because of this, they need to be aware of the human principles required for high-performance teams within the different collaborative models.

For **the hierarchical collaborative approach**, **incentives are required** for participation, while **soft skill sets and behaviors** have **little effect**. For **open innovation mall**, **incentives are both financial and nonfinancial**. **Monetary rewards** are given for solving problems. Since this is an open participation, nonfinancial rewards include **bragging rights, inclusion, and adding to resumes**.

The **minimum skill set** for this type of collaboration is **having curiosity** toward solving the problem, **competence in the knowledge domain**, and **few soft skills** among participants. One **necessary behavior** required is **the promotion of diversity**. Innovative breakthroughs result from conversations with external customers and outsiders who bring unique solutions.

Since the **open source approach** is flat, **some incentives** are required for the participation needed to reach a solution. The open participation **soft skill sets** and **behaviors** have **some effect** with successful collaboration. For **open source**, **incentives are both financial and nonfinancial**. **Monetary rewards** are given to those that contribute, and **nonfinancial rewards** include bragging rights, inclusion, developing skill, and adding to resumes.

The **minimum skill set** for this collaboration type is **curiosity** to solve the problem, **generosity** toward others’ contributions, and **competence** in the knowledge domain with **some soft skills** when occasionally interacting with others. There are two necessary behaviors required, which include **the promotion of diversity** and **psychological safety**. This occurs by accepting each other’s knowledge, teaching, and learning.

For the **hierarchical collaborative structure**, **incentives are required** for participation, but **soft skill sets and behaviors determine a successful collaboration**. For an **elite circle**, **incentives are both financial and nonfinancial**. Like open participation models, **nonfinancial rewards** include bragging rights, inclusion, and adding to resumes. Necessary skills of **equality, generosity, curiosity** toward your colleagues’ ideas, along with empathy and emotional intelligence, are essential for success. 

Some behaviors required are safety, building trust, and aligning body language. Psychological safety is of key importance because this is a closed elite group of participants that must be confident in speaking up, making mistakes, and knowing that they are heard. An elite circle is not just a group working together, but a group that trusts each other and is built on honesty and transparency. When working together in an elite circle, aligning body language that promotes inclusion and warmth is central to creating collaborative relationships.

For the flat collaborative approach, some incentives are required for participation, but since this is also closed, soft skill sets and behaviors determine a successful collaboration. For a consortium, incentives are both financial and nonfinancial. Monetary rewards are given for solving problems. Like the open participation models, nonfinancial rewards include bragging rights, inclusion, and adding to resumes. Here, equality, generosity, and curiosity toward your colleagues’ ideas, along with empathy and emotional intelligence, are necessary for success. 

Some behaviors required are safety, building trust, and aligning body language. In a consortium, the degree of trust is higher than the elite circle because it is flat, so this environment requires sharing costs, risks, and technological challenges. Again, because this is a closed group with a shared passion, psychological safety is required for personal contribution. 

A consortium has not only a shared goal but also a personal goal. Honesty, trust, and psychological safety are required to successfully collaborate. When working together in a consortium where the team can see each other, like with an elite circle, body language needs to demonstrate inclusion and warmth.

It is important that organizations have an emotionally safe environment in which to collaborate. To achieve this, organizations need to provide both financial and nonfinancial incentives to innovate and nurture various soft skills for collaboration. Therefore, organizations need to be aware of the human principles required for high-performance teams within the four collaborative models. For each collaborative approach, participant behaviors need to be assessed. Participants should apply or get trained in the necessary skills to effectively collaborate for innovation.

### Technologies for team collaboration
Collaborative technology embodies the tools and systems designed to better facilitate group work in both office and remote locations. 

#### Tools Core Features
* Communication
* Conferencing
* Coordination
* Project management 

#### Communication tools
Communication technology allows for messages, chat groups, and conversations among two or more people via the internet. Communication tools are designed to be unstructured; they do not require formal scheduling and calendar sharing to be effective. Message platform examples include e-mail platforms, instant messages, and voice messages. This is a form of collaborative communication that may cause long delays but does allow more time for individual ideation and decision-making.

Basic messaging communication can be used for both hierarchical and flat governance with a closed participation.

Basic messaging communication is commonly used with the open-source collaborative model like the various open-source software platforms. Chat group collaborative communication tools are designed for real time back and forth participation and allow for expedient ideation and decision-making, but lack accuracy and reflection of ideas. 

Chat groups are recommended for the elite circle, especially if people are remote or not part of the organization. Blogs, forums, and wikis are forms of chat groups that allow asynchronous discussion. They can provide accuracy and reflection of ideas but are not in real time. Blogs and forums are recommended for a consortium, especially if people are remote or not part of the organization.  

#### Conferencing technology
Conferencing technology allows two or more people to communicate with each other in real time through traditional internet or private cloud-based applications using a unified display. The major difference between conferencing and communication is the ability for people to access, make changes to, and work on the same unified display, or for a single presenter to control a unified display. 

Video conferencing tools are best used in collaborative approaches that are closed and have a small number of collaborators, as they are real time and private document sharing applications can be applied to all collaboration models but are essential for open-source as they accelerate the contribution, learning, and testing of new content. 

Using shared digital whiteboards, participants can simultaneously ideate, review, and mark-up images, models, and any information or data presented. A shared digital whiteboard is recommended for a closed, collaborative approach due to the small number of participants. A digital whiteboard is recommended for the hierarchical elite circle to guide, control, and document the ideation and solutions. It is also recommended for the flat consortium, which allows participants to share and express ideas and solutions. 

#### Co-ordination technology
Co-ordination technology allows participants to connect interpersonally and to share and arrange work tasks and activities to create an efficient and multifunctional team. It provides conference technology with additional scheduling, document control, and voting functionality. Workflow and resource scheduling features provide accountability for individuals as well as the team. This simplifies meeting support and shared calendars. Scheduling functions are required for a closed, collaborative approach due to the small number of participants. Document proofing and version control features go beyond document sharing and provide the ability to review, approve, and reject documents as well as artwork, videos, and images among internal or external participants. These collaborative features are needed for a closed participation to provide real-time feedback and interaction. 

Prediction markets allow people to predict the possible outcomes of future events through voting. This data is essential when developing new ideas and solutions for all the collaborative approaches but is recommended for the open and hierarchical innovation.

Mall Playtoy, a well-known creative toy company, has an open platform where users of all ages can submit their ideas. Users vote and rate the ideas, and the company decides based on popularity which ideas they produce as a prototype and eventual production. 

#### Project management technology 
Allows groups to perform more complex, interdependent work for a common goal. It facilitates costing and budgeting, assigning individual task work functions, and achieving team goals and milestones from an account and budgeting perspective. Since collaboration involves people and time is money, some collaborative applications have features to track and submit time, generate, and send invoices and track expenditures and approve reimbursements. This feature can be applied for all models, but especially to closed participation models where the individuals are compensated and may require travel.

For example, a company invited a handful of selected partners to join its Microelectronics Alliance Consortia for developing semiconductor technology throughout the life cycle of design to production. Project management was employed to provide a constant transparency of the innovation life-cycle. 

Collaboration is more than just sharing ideas and knowing when to meet. It is also about tracking project milestones and deliverables. This is required for successful collaboration, for innovation. These collaborative technology features can be applied for all the models but specially to closed participation models where the individuals are compensated, and timelines are critical. Although there are many choices for collaborative technology in the marketplace, most of these tools can be segmented by their core features that primarily support communication, conferencing, coordination, and project management. Communication tools provide basic unstructured collaboration such as messages and chat groups. Conferencing embodies video conferencing, document sharing, and shared digital whiteboards. Coordination technology allows groups to perform more complex, interdependent work for a common goal. Project management involves accounting, budgeting, and project planning.

### Collaborative technology challenges
Some organizations face difficulty in collaborating due to technological challenges, which ultimately limits their innovation. Organizations may also block approved external collaborators. It is essential that organizations overcome these technological roadblocks to position collaborative teams towards successful innovation. 

Safe Fly, an aerospace company, decided to solicit aerospace designers outside its company, that is in an elite circle. However, their current information technology (IT) infrastructure did not allow any external communication that provided file attachments. Working with its internal IT partners, a risk averted solution was implemented that applied typical encryption coupled with private Universal Serial Bus (USB) dongles. 

Embracing technology, especially new collaborative technology that involves people-to-people interactions inevitably brings human resistance. There are many reasons for resistance, but the major concerns are newness, habitual behavior, and exposure. The new technology can feel like a difficult change and additional work. People may feel they need more time to learn, hence the benefits are not always obvious. Involving employees early on with choosing the collaborative technology can make it feel more like a benefit than a new tool.

Alternately, some people are set in their ways and are not early adopters, so they will naturally resist. For this sub-population, not only is training required, but the collaborative technology has to deliver on the wow factor. The technology must be fun, and people may need constant motivation to adopt the new way. Several time-tested fun learning methods are lunch and learns, scavenger hunts, and bingo style games coupled with prizes, perks, incentives, and recognition. Collaborative technology by its nature creates more transparency that poses challenges in the organization. The activity of individuals contributing content exposes more interactions and conversations, and for some people this creates a feeling of competition. 

More than almost any other technology, video conferencing and collaboration technology rely on a constant, reliable network connection. Think of the times when you were attending a remote meeting and the moderator apologized for technology issues. When organizations embark on collaboration technology, there will always be the decision to make or buy. Leadership will have to decide to develop and maintain the technology in-house or pay for a service provider and carrier. The decision is based on the availability of resources within the organization that can develop, build, maintain, and support the collaboration technology in the long term. If not, the alternative is to pay a service provider and carrier for collaborative technology. As a precaution to avoid disruptions, ensure that your network connection has the proper capacity bandwidth for new and future collaboration technology.

Organizations need to ensure their video conferencing and collaborative technology properly integrates within their current IT stack. Any incompatibility can slow down or prevent the use of your video and collaborative technologies, in the worst case, this incompatibility could take the network down, leading to a catastrophic failure. For example, the company needs to provide videos for collaboration, but its internal system could not provide the bandwidth and display any videos. When introducing collaborative technologies that allow for document sharing and remote desktop control, internal networks can be exposed to malicious hacker attacks. 

Introducing collaboration technology has human and IT challenges. Regarding human challenges, it is important to involve people in the selection and implementation process while providing ample support during the rollout. For IT challenges, it is best to plan a phased implementation of IT services and features that will provide a solid, secure, and manageable foundation for growth.

### Mitigating Risks in Collaborative Technologies 
#### Preventing access from outside and unauthorized users
Determine who does and does not need access to certain files, especially when collaborating with open participation models.

The best policy for preventing access from outside users is to ask,
* Do I know and trust this person?
* Do they need to be involved? 

This is then translated through a secure IT process. 

#### Preventing data loss and managed storage
Most video conferencing and screen-sharing collaborative solutions have recording capabilities such as audio, visual, and text transcriptions of the conversations. These recordings are stored in the cloud, leaving them vulnerable, dependent on the security of the host provider. 

Encryption is the key, and as sensitivity increases, implementing a stronger encryption standard such as 195 or 256 bits will significantly reduce the risk of data loss due to hacking and infections. 

#### Maintaining network availability
Bandwidth issues such as slow or inconsistent connections can lure bandwidth-targeted attacks from hackers, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) incidents and other malicious data disruptions. 

Companies utilizing collaborative solutions need to invest in the right level of bandwidth. Standard security measures like firewalls and malware scanners play an integral role in blocking outside interference.

### Stakeholder Engagement
The introduction of cross-functional teams can promote cohesion, optimize efforts, and help achieve goals faster. Cross-functional teams can clearly define the goals and scope of a project and communicate them to all the stakeholders. 

### Maximizing cross-functional team performance 
A **team** is a **group** of interdependent people who are working together to achieve a **common goal**. 

The most common team is the **functional team** or the **natural work group**. For example, an engineering services department is composed of eight engineers all reporting to the same manager. 

A **self-directed** team is a group of employees responsible for a particular product. They are empowered to manage tasks themselves and make all decisions necessary for the products production. 

Some cross-functional teams are **planned and permanent**, but most are **ad-hoc**. Some cross-functional teams are self-directed from the outset, but most are not or at best, negotiate a level of empowerment as part of their development process.

A cross-functional team comprises of people from different backgrounds and varied skill sets that can help an organization grow. Great things happen when people with diverse educational backgrounds, work and life experiences, knowledge and skills, work styles, and cultural differences merge their efforts for the benefit of the organization and the customer. 

However, such efforts in cross-functional collaboration are also fraught with obstacles, and the road to success includes many barriers.

The leader should also be aware of the competitive advantages of a cross-functional team and should be able to make full use of them in the implementation stage. 

An example of a typical cross-functional team is a new product development team that depending on the company or industry, may include representatives from research, product testing, operations or manufacturing, marketing, sales, purchasing, government affairs, and project management. The leader may come from any of these functions.

#### Competitive Advantages of a Cross-Functional Team
* **Speed**: Cross-functional teams get work done faster. 
* **Complexity**: Cross-functional teams improve the organization’s ability to solve complex problems. 
* **Creativity**: Cross-functional teams increase the creative capacity of an organization. 
* **Customer focus**: Cross-functional teams improve the organization’s ability to address customer needs and demands.

#### Obstacles encountered by a cross-functional team
* Ineffective team leadership
* Lack of empowerment
* Ambiguous goals
* Poor stakeholder relationships
* Ineffective human resource systems
* Conflict among team members
* Ineffective management

The ability to identify potential roadblocks to a team's success is the critical first step for a leader who wants to improve the effectiveness of a cross-functional team. It is much more difficult to lead a **cross-functional** team than a **functional** team. 
##### Leadership
The cross-functional team comprises people from different backgrounds, reporting to different managers. In addition, the individual team members may not have worked together in the past or, in some cases, may have had negative experiences in similar collaborative efforts. 

Furthermore, the team often deals with issues that require a high degree of technical expertise.

Furthermore, the team often deals with issues that require a high degree of technical expertise.

In addition to this technical expertise, leading a cross-functional team also requires high-level interpersonal skills. It can often be difficult to find people with this combination of **technical** and **interpersonal** skill sets. 

##### Empowerment - the authority to make decisions quickly
If the team members are not clear on what powers they have, they will ask their managers before making any key decision. Most important, if speed is an important organization goal—rapid response to customer inquiries—then empowerment is a necessary means to that end. The lack of authority to make key decisions equals a slow, cumbersome process.

##### Ambiguous Goals
If the leader of a cross-functional team asks its members to state the team's goals, each member should respond with a similar answer. If the team members have different responses, the goals are too ambiguous.

Even team members who are clear about their deliverables, due dates, and the tasks for which they are personally responsible may have little sense of how their role helps achieve the overarching goal of the team.

Lack of clarity about team goals leads to lack of commitment by team members. Goal clarity means that the entire team works together on a common goal. If the customer is unhappy, the whole team is unhappy and works together to solve the problem.

##### Relationship with Stakeholders
Typical stakeholders for a cross-functional team include 
* senior management,
* functional department managers,
* support groups,
* customers, 
* and vendors. 

Stakeholders can create pathways for the team, but they can also be a source of roadblocks. They can, as in this case, make it difficult to utilize resources critical to the team's success or slow down team progress by insisting on frequent reports and presentations. 

Failure to build effective stakeholder relationships can derail potential team's success.

Recognition of individuals for outstanding performance will always be necessary, but it is important that the organization also acknowledge individuals who are exceptional team players. 

Wen reward systems do not recognize outstanding team performance, collaboration among team members suffers. 

However, when the team members know that if the team succeeds, everyone in the team will be rewarded, they will be motivated to collaborate with their teammates.

##### Conflicts
Despite the fact that many people participate in team meetings, most people are not prepared to collaborate with other people on business teams. Few people understand group dynamics, and even fewer have the skills to work cooperatively with others in the workplace.

A cross-functional team is particularly susceptible to conflicts among members because people come to the team with specific **interpersonal styles**, **diverse work orientations**, **cultural differences**, **widely divergent goals**, and **negative stereotypes** about other departments. 

The potential for destructive team conflict is exacerbated by a team leader's lack of effective consensus-building skills, inefficient dispute management expertise, and poor meeting facilitation capacity.

##### Poor Management
At staff meetings, senior managers may say all the right things, but when it's time to provide concrete action with decisions on budget allocation, assignment of people, or elimination of barriers, they are ineffective. 

While senior management plays a critical role, functional department managers are often more important players because they provide daily support in the form of tangible resources needed by the team. They have the power to send a clear message to their team representatives and senior management that the work of this cross-functional team is important and everything should be done to ensure the team succeeds.

The senior manager should make it clear which decisions the team is empowered to make and which decisions must be approved by the management team. At the end of the meeting, encourage team members to ask questions to further clarify the types of issues they have regarding their authority. 

### Strategies for a successful cross-functional team 
The seven success factors that help ensure the success of a cross-functional team are: 
1. Team leadership
2. Team empowerment
3. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time bound (SMART) goal setting 
4. Productive stakeholder relationships 
5. HR support systems 
6. Team conflict resolution 
7. Management’s role in effective team development

The critical differentiating factor among successful and unsuccessful team leaders is the ability to manage team issues. Rarely do we find teams failing because leaders lack sufficient technical expertise.

The leaders should have a working knowledge of the subject matter. He or she should be able to ask the right questions about the technical issues, understand the responses, and have the good sense to react when something appears to be incorrect.

High-level group process skills, including the ability to ask good questions, actively listen to ensure clear communication, encourage member participation, use various decision-making skills such as consensus, deal with dysfunctional team member behavior, and facilitate team meetings that achieve substantive outcomes.

The leader should help the team set clear goals and then keep the team focused on achieving those goals. Research clearly indicates that having specific performance objectives is the critical differentiating factor between **high-performing** and **average** teams.

The leader should build the relationships and manage communication with the team's key stakeholders. And while not precisely a skill, a key style component of the successful leader is **flexibility**.

Across most industries, successful cross-functional teams display a common set of factors. You can use these factors to assess your current teams and examine ways you can develop and implement these factors in teams that you lead.

#### Team Empowerment
Empowerment is an interactive process between management and the team that results in the teams being able to make decisions about specific aspects of their work without getting any approval. Empowering a team is a four-step process. 
1. Management provides the team with an overarching goal, such as creating a more comfortable car seat without changing the overall dimensions.
2. The cross-functional team translates the goal into a set of specific performance objectives and a plan, including milestones, tasks, and the budget designed to achieve the objectives. 
3. Management and the team review the plan and come to an agreement on a final plan. The agreement means that the team is empowered to carry out the plan without checking every decision with management.
4. Team provides management with regular updates on the implementation of the plan.

#### SMART Goals
Creating team goals is a process that begins with a broad goal, often assigned by the senior management. The team then turns this general goal into specific performance objectives. The term "SMART" is used to identify the key components of an effective goal. S stands for specific, which means that the outcome is clear to all team members. M stands for measurable, which ensures that the outcome can be observed and counted. A stands for attainable, which means that even though the end result is a challenge, it is achievable. R stands for relevant, which means that the outcome is aligned with the overall goals and strategy of the organization. And T stands for time-bound, which means that the goal will be accomplished within a specific time period.

For example, the senior management communicates a general goal with the team to improve their customer satisfaction. The smart goal will be to respond to all customer inquiries within 24 hours. 

#### Productive stakeholder relationships
Cross-functional teams have many needs that only a stakeholder can provide. Teams need resources, including people from functional departments, information, including data from support groups and service departments, access to and the reduction of barriers from senior management, and tangible work output from vendors and suppliers.

Successful cross-functional teams plan for the development of effective relationships with key stakeholders. A plan should include the following elements:
* Identify your key stakeholders.
* Look for common interests and needs.
* Communicate your team's work.
* Select a boundary manager to work with each stakeholder.
* Identify potential relationship barriers with each stakeholder.
* And define specific steps you will take to develop an effective relationship with each stakeholder.

#### Team conflict resolution
Conflict in cross-functional teams is a part of the nature of these types of teams. When experts come together with different perspectives on an issue, differences will emerge. In fact, it is important that differences surface because they bring in a better solution. Dealing with conflict is central to the development of positive group dynamics and effective team development.

Recommendations for managing differences and making effective use of diversity among team members include:
* Training for cross-functional team development must include units on conflict resolution and skill sessions, on active listening, asking questions, and consensus building.
* Creating early opportunities for cross-functional team members to work together on subtasks or committees. One important study reported that when team members work together over a time period, they stop thinking of other team members as outsiders.
* Engaging a facilitator to help manage the differences and create a consensus. 
* And finally, everyone should have realistic expectations about team conflicts. If a team is built with a diverse membership, then the team members must have the patience to work through the differences to achieve a better outcome.

#### Management’s role in effective team development
iManagement should play an active role in setting the direction and providing the support necessary for successful implementation. 

Specifically, management should ensure that information flows to the entire team and the team leaders, ensure that human resource systems support, cross-organizational collaboration and teamwork.

Key systems include a performance management system that includes performance on a
cross-functional team in a person's annual appraisal; learning and development opportunities to help people learn how to be a team leader and workshops for senior management on how to provide leadership and support; and, a rewards program that fosters collaboration, recognizes team players, and rewards teams for goal achievement.

Manage a culture transformation that moves toward an environment where teamwork and team players open sharing of information and expertise, functional and cultural differences, consensus building, and empowerment are valued, and rewarded.

Imagine that a project team has successfully implemented a new financial reporting system at various corporate locations around the world. The team received a team award consisting of a significant bonus for each team member. At the project closure meeting, it became clear that the team could not have achieved these milestones without the cooperation of the systems staff at each corporate site around the world. However, since technically they were not team members, they are not eligible to receive the bonus. How can the leader handle this situation?

Ideally, this issue should have been addressed when the team was established and before the project started. At that time, management should have allocated a certain amount of money for the recognition of staff at local sites. However, if this did not happen, the team leader will now submit a request to management for additional funds to recognize the support staff. If management approves the request, the problem is solved. However, if management rejects the request, the team faces a dilemma.

One dramatic solution will be for each team member to donate a portion of his or her bonus to create a fund for the recognition of systems staff. Alternatively, the team can prepare framed certificates of appreciation for each site or for each person who made a contribution to the project. A letter could also be sent to the manager of each local site, thanking them for the cooperation of their staff that led to the success of the project.

### Rewards and recognition
While most of the strategies for creating and sustaining a successful cross-functional team focused on team actions, at some point the team has to address individual member concerns and issues. Team members want to know if all their hard work on behalf of the team will be rewarded. 

Recognition is an acknowledgment of a team's success. It can be as simple as coffee and cake, or a pizza party in the conference room when the team releases a new financial software product on time.

The reward is a payout to the whole team based on a pre-announced formula. For example, all members receive a certain amount of money if they complete the project on time and within the budget.

The purpose of recognition and rewards are to reinforce the team concept so that nobody wins unless the whole team wins.

### Effectiveness of cross-functional team leadership
Leading a cross-functional team requires high-level group process skills because the leader must bring together a group of people who report to different managers, represent different business units, and have different working styles.

A cross-functional team leader must be proficient in the following skills: 
* The leader must have a certain level of technical and team management skill sets. 
* The leader should have a working knowledge of the subject matter. 
* The leader should help the team set clear goals and then keep the team focused on achieving those goals.
* The leader must influence the cross-functional team and help in building trusting relationships with them.

Leading a cross-functional team requires more than just being a good facilitator. Pure facilitators do not have sufficient technical expertise to understand the content of the discussion they are trying to manage. The level of skill required is referred to as a working knowledge of the subject matter.

Most important, team leaders have to be honest about what they know and what they don't know. The beauty of a cross-functional team is that there are other team members who are there to provide their expertise in a variety of areas. So, the team leader does not have to know everything about every area represented on the team but should be honest about his or her limitations.

While it is difficult to assess with great precision whether you have a working knowledge of a particular area, when a subject matter expert on your team makes a technical presentation, you should know enough to: 
* Ask the right questions.
* Interpret the answers correctly.
* Get a sense if the presenter is being completely honest.
* Recognize if a proposed solution will work in the real world.
* And question whether a request for additional funds is necessary.

Leading a cross-functional team requires high-level group process skills because the leader must bring together a group of people reporting to different managers and representing different business units and goals. These required group process skills will vary by team, but some of the most common include:
* Active listening to ensure clear communication.
* Asking good questions to engage team members and bring out important ideas.
* Gatekeeping that encourages all members to share their expertise and opinions and ensures that discussions are not dominated by a few members.
* Using decision-making tools such as consensus.
* Managing a process that results in the development of smart goals and a plan to accomplish the goals. 
* Planning and facilitating an effective meeting that results in decisions and other important outcomes. 
* Recognizing team members for their contributions to team success.
* Celebrating team accomplishments. 

Leading a cross-functional team is a difficult job because it requires managing a diverse group of experts and focusing them on achieving a difficult goal. The challenge, therefore, is to lead by influence rather than by traditional hierarchy or authority. This involves building trusting relationships, supporting the work of the team, involving members in creating the goals and project plans, convincing members to move in a certain direction, empowering members to take independent action, and recognizing members contributions to the overall team effort. 

Specifically, leading by influence requires that the team leader:
* Be a role model, pitch in, and do work to move the team forward.
* Be authentic, tell the truth, give honest assessments, don't minimize the real issues, make it clear when a change is necessary.
* Be accessible, allow team members to voice their concerns, be available and easy to talk to. Promptly return email and phone messages, and
* Be consistent; ensure that your actions match your words, and do not take unnecessary shortcuts.

The leader of a cross-functional team is responsible for orchestrating the communications with key stakeholders, including functional department managers, who need to know how the team is doing. Functional department managers play a critical role in the success of a cross-functional team because they provide the day-to-day support in the form of resources needed by the team.

Senior managers who need to know about the team's progress in relation to its goals, the team's need for additional resources and potential problems and changes in the project plan, especially the timeline, and support groups and service departments such as information technology, purchasing, customer service, and government affairs need to be aware of future resource needs and required support services and that their work is appreciated by the team.

The team leader sometimes needs to communicate more actively to provide team members with the space to get the necessary work done without outside interference. Solid communication by the leader can prevent frequent requests for formal project review presentations. 

Imagine a situation where the team leader does not have the team management skills to effectively handle the relationship issues in the team. Meetings get bogged down in discussions of minute issues, and there are nasty arguments among team members. The team leader was appointed by the senior management sponsor of the team. How can the team members improve the situation? The team should work together to develop a plan of action that might include:
* Creating an agenda template, emphasizing specific outcomes, and including time allocations for each agenda topic. 
* Submitting a request to the human resource department for facilitation assistance to help deal with the conflicts and irrelevant discussions that derail the meetings and creating a set of meeting behaviors that all members are expected to follow, such as being brief and to the point. 
* Limit your comments to the topic under discussion. Do not interrupt other members when they are speaking.
* And be willing to compromise to help the team reach a decision. 

As a leader of a cross-functional team, you need to have a unique mix of skill sets. Leading a cross-functional team requires high-level group process skills because the leader must bring together a group of people who report to different managers, represent different business units, and have different working styles.

A cross-functional team comprises people from different backgrounds and varied skill sets that can help an organization grow. Great things happen when people with diverse educational backgrounds, work and life experiences, knowledge and skills, work styles, and cultural differences merge their efforts for the benefit of the organization and the customer. However, such efforts in cross-functional collaboration are also fraught with obstacles, and the road to success includes many barriers.

### Co-Leadership
This involves the division of responsibilities between two people. The designated **team leader**, who focuses on the specific team tasks such as the technical or scientific issues, and the **project manager** who concentrates on the group dynamics and team management issues. This person usually plans the meeting and manages the interactions during the meeting.

### Facilitation assistance
In this method, a trained facilitator, who is usually the technical or scientific expert, supports the team leader.

**The leader** is responsible for the overall leadership of the team. **The facilitator** helps the leader plan the meeting, offers advice on various process issues, intervenes during the meeting, and provides coaching to the leader after the meeting.

### Training existing team leaders
Some organizations believe the best alternative is providing in-depth leadership training for existing team leaders, because it is assumed the leaders already have the required technical or scientific expertise. 

The training focuses exclusively on **group dynamics**, **meeting planning**, **facilitation skills**, and **communication skills**.

### Knowledge Check
* **Overall strategic direction**. While financial, public relations, community, and marketing people are good to have on board, you should gain buy-in for the project from the senior team participants who are involved with the organization’s strategic direction. This is recommended as they understand why the project is part of executing the overall strategic direction of the organization. 
* **Actual customer impressions at the point of transaction**.
Feedback does not help you align your communications with your manager’s wishes, your competitors’ efforts, or your past branding. It is used to confirm that your message is aligned with your customers’ impressions at the point of transaction.
* **Firewalls**. Standard security measures like firewalls and malware scanners play an integral role in blocking outside interference. However, bandwidth, video conferencing, and human resistance do not block outside interference.
* **Necessary**. In a closed and flat participation model, soft skills are necessary, and important for successful collaboration.
* **Virtual team members live and work in different business and cultural environments, whereas colocated team members share a common context**. In co-located teams, team members share the same business, cultural, and historical environment as the backdrop for their work. In virtual teams, members live and work in different environments, and do not start with a common framework for working together. This makes managing a virtual team more challenging.

### Summary
* The introduction of cross-functional teams promotes cohesion across an organization and optimizes efforts, which can help teams achieve goals faster. 
* The seven success factors that ensure the success of a cross-functional team are team leadership, team empowerment, SMART goal setting, productive stakeholder relationships, HR support systems, team conflict resolution, and management’s role in effective team development.
