# Project Management Part 1
## Project Management
### Project overview
A project is a **unique and temporary endeavor** designed to accomplish a specific goal.

A project has:
* an established beginning and end
* a clearly defined scope
* allocated resources

### Benefits of project management
Project management is the application of 
* knowledge
* skills
* experience
* tools
* techniques 
that guide a project to achieve its objectives on time and within budget.

Before initiating a project, an organization performs the following tasks to analyze the project's potential financial returns:
* Comparing the costs involved in the project with the benefits.
* Calculating the amount to be invested for a particular period of time.
* Identifying potential risk factors for the project.

### Project Management Lifecycle
Project management consists of four phases. 
* Selection and initiation
* Planning
* Execution
* Monitoring and closeout

#### Phase 1: Selection and initiation
Defining the project meaning sorting out the project goals, scope, and resources, as well as the roles needed for the project team. 

A project is a unique, temporary endeavor, designed to accomplish a specific goal.
* Projects are temporary because they have an established beginning and end.
* They also have a clearly defined scope and allocated resources.
* Projects can be simple or complex.

The financial factors used to determine the future profitability of a project include:
* Cost-benefit analysis
* The time value of money
* The present value of future payments
* The level of risk

When using a cost-benefit analysis, compare the costs involved in the project with the benefits it will generate. If your analysis reveals the costs are greater than the benefits, you should reject the project, but if you find the benefits outweigh the costs, you should investigate the project further. 

**Sometimes you may have to choose a less profitable project because of**
* legal
* safety
* or technology requirements.

##### The time value of money
The money you have today is better than the same amount of money tomorrow.

Money invested today will be worth more in the future.

##### Compounding determines the future value of an investment
If you invest $10,000 today at an interest rate of 5%, the value at the end of the first year will be $10,500. At the end of the second year, it will be $11,025, and at the end of the third year, it will be $11,576.25.

##### Discounting - the value of a project's future payments is reduced to calculate its present value
If your company expects a payment of $25,000 in five years, $25,000 is the total future value of an amount. To determine the present value of this future payment, you need to calculate how much your company needs to invest today to receive $25,000 in five years.

While evaluating a project, remember that the discount rate used to determine the present value of the future cash inflow is the most important part of any financial evaluation method. This is because the discount rate reflects the risk of the project. You should give higher-risk projects a higher discount rate.

##### Some major project risks you should look out for are:
* **Project length**: The longer the project, the greater the risk if it extends beyond the schedule and budget.
* **Feasibility of completion**: Large, complex projects that span many years may lose momentum and even lose funding to newer projects or company initiatives.
* **The technology factor**: This refers to the risk posed by how easily competitors can duplicate the project, essentially eliminating the competitive advantage the project may provide.
* The accuracy of the estimated cost or savings on the initial investment.
* Overall project operating costs, volatility in the currency exchange rate.
* Additional investments that may be required as the project progresses.

##### Nonfinancial benefits to the organization
* the project's link, or lack thereof, to the company's strategic plan
* the side benefits, such as higher employee retention or increased productivity
* interdependencies among projects

##### Roles that may evaluate potential projects and make recommendations to leadership regarding project selection
* Project Manager
* Senior Executive
* Portfolio Manager
* Product Management Group
* Operational Excellence Team

Once a project is selected and authorized, the project manager is assigned, and project initiation officially begins.

#### Phase 2: Project planning
In the project planning phase, you will determine the steps to actually achieve the project goals — the “how” of completing a project. A project plan, which consists of six components, is used to evaluate the project and track its progress against the schedule. 

##### Statement of Work (SOW)
The SOW is the foundation of the project plan and summarizes all aspects of the project.

The SOW should include the following:
* Scope of the project
* Benefits
* Expected results
* Resources
* Risks
* Completion date

##### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
The WBS is a framework that lists the deliverables needed to complete the project and states who owns which deliverable. In general, the WBS lists the first 25-30% of the project work.

##### Project schedule
The project schedule includes all WBS activities in the exact sequence and time frame they are to be performed in.

##### Responsibility matrix
The responsibility matrix or the (RACI) matrix is a chart that helps define the role of each team member and holds each person accountable for their assigned activities.

In a RACI matrix:
* R stands for Responsible, who is doing the work.
* A stands for Accountable, who makes decisions about work completion.
* C stands for Consultant, who provides input.
* I stands for Informed, who should know about decisions made and actions taken.

##### Resource requirements
A resource requirement document helps to account for the availability of resources, such as labor, machines, and materials. These resources are most commonly shared between projects and project managers.

##### Project budget
The project manager uses the financial information at their disposal to draw up the necessary budget for the project, which includes labor, materials, machines or equipment, and supplier or consultant costs. A budget may also include costs for contingencies, which are considered as project risks.

#### Statement of Work (SOW) and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

During the project planning phase, the PM develops the project plan consisting of six components:
1. The statement of work
2. The work breakdown structure
3. The schedule 
4. The responsibility matrix
5. Resource requirements
6. The budget

The components of the plan are often created in this order, **but not always**. 

##### SOW example
An SOW may be as simple as a bulleted list or table.

The SOW should include
* the project's scope
* benefits
* expected results
* measurements
* resources
* risks
* project interdependencies
* project interfaces
* external dependencies
* completion date

1. **Project scope**. To update the cooling system in the company's largest production area.
2. **Benefits**. This project will improve the air quality and overall working conditions in the main production facility by providing more efficient cooling and air purification.
3. **Expected results**. The air quality in the main production area will improve by 30%.
..

##### The WBS is a framework that lists the deliverables needed to complete the project and states who owns each deliverable.

##### WBS example

Overall project scope is broken down into groups of major deliverables that the project must produce.

1. Deliverable - select and purchase the new cooling system.
 1.1. establish selection criteria
 1.2. determine operational specifications
 1.3. draft the purchase contract
 1.4. obtain purchase approval

In general, the WBS lists the first 25 to 30% of the project work. This should cover the specific details of the major activities for each deliverable. 

##### Questions that help in creating WBS:
* Who or what role is responsible for the activity?
* How long should it take to complete the activity?
* Are there any costs associated with the activity?

#### Schedule, responsibility matrix, resource requirements, and budget

When creating a project plan, you should start with the two largest items, **the statement of work** and **the work breakdown structure**.

#### Project Schedule
##### Steps to accomplish
1. Estimate the amount of time needed for each activity.
2. Determine the sequence of activities by creating a network diagram, this is often done using a project management software tool.
3. Calculate the total time needed to complete the project.
4. Display the schedule visually using a Gantt or milestone chart.

#### Responsibility RACI Matrix
This chart helps define the role of each team member and holds each person accountable for their assigned activities. The matrix is a good communication tool for the project team. By sharing the matrix with team members, you create a foundation for shared accountability.

In a RACI matrix,
* R is for Responsible, who is doing the work.
* A is for Accountable, who makes decisions about work completion.
* C is for Consulted, who provides input.
* I is for Informed, who should know about decisions made and actions taken.

#### Resource Requirements
* Labor
* Machines
* Materials

#### Prepare Project Budget
##### The key components of the budget are 
* labor
* materials
* machines or equipment
* supplier or consultant costs

##### Other components
* costs for contingencies, which are considered project risks

##### Two stages budget creation
* **preliminary cost estimate** - 20 to 50% variance from the actual cost of the project
* **final cost estimate** - within 5 to 10% of the project's actual cost

#### Phase 3: Project implementation
##### The main roles involved in project implementation
* Project Sponsor
* Project Manager
* Project Team

###### Project Sponsor
The project sponsor is the one who champions the project through the selection process and provides sign off formally approving the project to move forward. Typically, the project sponsor holds a position of authority within the organization. 

The responsibilities of a project sponsor include the following:
* Appointing the project manager
* Can be instrumental in obtaining early buy-in for the project from other executives
* Providing additional resources if original resource availability becomes limited
* Supports the PM and project team
* Serving as a point of escalation
* Offering guidance during disagreements
* Removing obstacles encountered by the team
* Acknowledges and celebrates completion of key deliverables
* Signing off on completed projects
* Participating in post project discussions

###### Project Manager
The project manager is the person responsible for the entire project, from initiation to closeout.

The responsibilities of a project manager include the following: 
* Selecting the project team
* Monitoring the project
* Overseeing the change control process
* Keeping an open line of communication with sponsors, teams, and stakeholders at all times

###### Project Team
The project team is selected in a well-balanced manner. The team members must have the technical knowledge to support the project's goals and objectives. 

The selection is conducted by considering each candidate's skills, character, and work ethic. 

Team member characteristics include the following:
* A commitment to the project's goals 
* Technical competence in a required area
* Cooperation and flexibility
* The ability to be a team player
* Effective interpersonal skills
* The ability to work independently in a self-directed environment
* The ability to stay focused and work within a tight timeline
* The ability to work for multiple bosses
* A willingness to share responsibility and power

###### The four stages of team development as coined by psychologist Bruce Tuckman
* **Forming**. The team members meet and determine their rules of conduct. They learn about the potential opportunities and challenges of the project, agree on the project's goals, and list the resources needed to meet those goals.
* **Storming**. The team members encounter the first signs of conflict. This may be where team members point fingers or jockey to get a decision to go their way. As the PM don't immediately intervene, if you do, the team may not settle successfully into their roles and learn to compromise.
* **Norming**. The team settles into a routine of open communication, cooperation, and respect. Typically, a team moves back and forth between the norming and storming stages.
* **Performing**. The team starts functioning as a truly cohesive unit. The team meets their milestones and makes decisions without the PM or sponsor having to intervene.

The project execution phase is where the team carries out the project work. 

To assign the scheduled work, the PM uses work packages, which are the smallest deliverables in the WBS. Each work package has a cost assigned to it in the budget. Making assignments at the work package level also helps the PM track overall progress, update the project schedule as needed, and review the quality of the work.

The PM must be flexible while managing the project schedule and work assignments. 

To manage the project budget, the PM tracks the amount of money assigned to each work package.

As the PM, your main concern is when you're tracking efforts indicate a variance from the original budget, but note that these variances aren't always negative. A positive variance means that the project is ahead of schedule or under budget. But when you spot a negative variance, review the status of the project right away and reallocate resources to activities that are behind schedule or over budget.

In all projects, the execution phase continues as long as there are still work packages and project milestones to complete.

#### Phase 4: Project monitoring and closeout

##### Quantitative and qualitative aspects of project monitoring
Determining what to measure and how is key to successful project monitoring. Projects generate lots of documentation, much of which is critical to project monitoring. Team members complete their assigned work packages and submit progress and expense reports, which helps the PM keep a close eye on the quantitative aspects of project monitoring. This includes how many hours are spent on each work package and whether the project is over or below the budgeted numbers.

There are two aspects of project monitoring.
1. **The quantitative aspects** of the project are recorded using the total number of hours spent on each package, whether the project is over or below the budgeted numbers, etc. 
2. **The qualitative aspect** of monitoring includes answers to questions, such as:
 * Are the stakeholders happy with the project's progress?
 * Are their expectations being met?
 * Does it seem that the end result will meet the stated objectives? 
 * What's the dynamic among the members of the project team?
 * Are project barriers being addressed quickly? 
 * Is there a way to optimize the amount of time spent in meetings?

###### Project monitoring offers several benefits including
* PM and team member accountability
* greater likelihood of future funding
* identification of inefficient processes
* higher performing project teams
* increased success of future projects by applying the lessons learned

##### Project closeout
This phase begins when the project is coming to an end, but the work is not quite complete. Before a project can end, the project stakeholders must agree that the project was completed to their satisfaction. 

In this stage, the project team documents the work they did, conducts a post implementation audit, and presents the final report to the project stakeholders. This includes all documents developed during the project planning phase, the completed project schedule depicting all variances from the planned schedule, the SOW, and the quantitative measurements used in the project.

The project team documents everything that someone not directly involved in the project might need to understand the work performed. This includes:
* All documents developed during the project planning phase
* The completed project schedule depicting all variances from the planned schedule
* The SOW, and the quantitative measurements used in the project
* The notes created during the project that detail the team's work or analysis that supports the team decisions
* A list of issues the team encountered and if and how they were resolved, also known as the issue log, and
* An opportunity list, which documents unresolved issues or opportunities identified during the project that fell outside the project's scope 

This documentation may be used for the next thirty days to one year after the project is completed to determine if the improvements made during the project are sustained.

During the closeout phase, the project team prepares a final report. This report captures the lessons learned, the successes and failures, and the opportunities identified during the project. The final report is a document for future project teams to learn from. It includes: 
* The executive summary of the project's original expenditure authorization
* The starting numbers and result goals achieved, and any schedule and budget variances recorded in the post-implementation audit
* The policies or procedures that were updated during or as a result of the project
* Diagrams or pictures that illustrate the changes implemented in the project, for example, photographs of the old cooling system at ABC manufacturing as well as the upgraded system once installed
* A list of any outstanding tasks, who will perform them, and an estimated completion date
* The opportunities identified during the project but not addressed due to lack of time or because they fell outside the project scope, and a lesson learned document

After preparing the final report, the ABC manufacturing project team holds a closeout meeting where they present the report to the project stakeholders.

At the end of the closeout, thank the team members and the stakeholders for their dedication to the project and the role each person played in its success. This is important because it recognizes the value of everyone's contributions.

### Project Scope and Schedule
#### Project change management
Project managers often face the issue of handling the project scope and incorporating the changes in the project. The changes outside the original project scope are handled by means of the project change management process. 

The project change management focuses on systematically managing changes and issues affecting the project. It helps by adapting to the approved changes to deliver the optimum level of value to the project sponsor within the project constraints. 

#### Project scope
The project scope includes quantifiable acceptance criteria for each major deliverable and the business outcomes the sponsor expects. Delineating a change control process in the plan enables project teams to change scope to address issues and changes through specified checkpoints and policies.

#### Project plan elements for change management 
Project managers use the project baseline metrics and a change control process to quickly quantify the impacts of proposed changes on the project, give decision-makers data needed to resolve requests, and update project team members and stakeholders on the resolution of proposed changes.

An approved scope baseline is the foundation for good change management. It is used to evaluate changes to original requirements and deliverables for acceptance, rejection, or deferment. The scope must include quantifiable acceptance criteria for each major deliverable and the business outcomes the sponsor expects.

Clearly defining the scope and approved acceptance metrics prevents disagreements about what was included in the original project requirements. Delineating a change control process in the plan enables project teams to change scope to address issues and changes through specified checkpoints and policies. It also determines who pays for a change.

##### The change control procedures:
* Explain how issues and changes are prioritized
* Coordinate everyone’s work to document, evaluate, and track the disposition of issues and change requests
* Identify decision-makers and their authority in review and approval, and
* Integrate change tracking, the project communications plan, and configuration management system

#### Exercising change control
A scope change requires a permanent deviation from the baseline plan that is managed via the change control process. A change control board or project steering committee supports and enforces integrated change control at the senior level. 

#### Key tools of change control
A central tool of the change control process is the change request form. This document is the catalyst for collaborative communication, impact analysis, and change integration into the project plan.

A change control board or project steering committee supports and enforces integrated change control at the senior level. The more delayed the introduction of a change is in the project life cycle, the more costly the execution. Therefore, the team should consist of senior stakeholders from business operations, finance, and risk to balance the review and decisions on requests.

A project manager uses a positive attitude toward change as a critical technique for successful change control. A confrontational mindset tends to lead project managers to attempt to discourage change, often annoying business stakeholders and end users dealing with a changing business environment. Experienced project managers use a collaborative approach to work with the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders to determine how best to adapt the project to new changes. Successful project delivery depends on change management, not control.

The project manager uses collaboration, communications, and team expertise to create transparency and objectivity in the change control process. Project managers rely on open collaboration between the request originator and project team members to gather and clarify all requirements and details for input into the impact analysis.

Prior to forwarding it to those with decision authority, the project manager and originator then review the impact report to identify areas of agreement and disagreement with the analysis. Project managers include an expiration date on trade-offs and options contained in the analysis to ensure a timely response to the originator and to avoid on-going project work in validating an approach.

#### Handling project scope creep
Scope creep pertains to small features added throughout the project life cycle or a few major changes that in sum total can have a significant impact on cost, time, and quality. Creep also relates to the time and cost aspects of the project.

#### Sizing analysis and change control levels
Scope creep pertains to small features added throughout the project life cycle or a few major changes that, in sum total, can have a significant impact on cost, time, and quality. 

In the absence of proper change control, the costs to the business surface schedule delays, costs of errors, and corrective actions.

##### Some considerations in structuring a best-fit change control process include:
* Significant project size, complexity, and risk profile.
* Projects that have strict schedule and cost constraints requiring increased focus.
* Projects with high visibility and strategic importance to the organization necessitating more structured processes.

##### Project scope creep can occur due to:
* Changes in business needs and environment
* Incomplete gathering of functional requirements prior to project execution
* Insufficient involvement of critical stakeholders, including the sponsor
* Lack of project sponsor support
* Poor implementation of change control

##### Five practices to avoid scope creep include:
* Involve sponsor, end users, and key stakeholders early in project planning.
* Thoroughly gather and analyze requirements during initial project planning and while defining baselines.
* Involve sponsor and critical stakeholders throughout the project phases via collaboration tools, status meetings, reports, and change impact analyses.
* Introduce a change control board or project steering committee that evaluates the risk and return of implementing changes to the project’s success.
* Refuse changes in requirements with proper rationale and support through the change control process.

#### Change management case study 
Change control is designed to evaluate changes against achieving the approved baseline goals in the project scope. 

Analysis of impacts and trade-offs may support consideration of whether to add the feature now or in a later release.

### Project Working Styles
#### Technology development lifecycle and business collaboration
Technology projects within business are undertaken to meet specific business objectives. These projects can only succeed through constant and effective collaboration. 

This collaboration and buy-in contribute to successful projects and outcomes. Technology Projects follow common processes known as a System or Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

#### Commonly used SDLC phases:
* Definition
* Design
* Development
* Delivery

#### Two commonly applied models of SDLC:
* **Waterfall** uses a phased, sequential approach
* **Agile** uses an iterative, cyclical approach

#### By Project Management Institute (PMI), Waterfall model consists of phases
* Initiating
* Planning
* Executing and controlling
* Closing

The waterfall model specifies processes and activities that take place within each phase. Processes such as risk management occur within all phases.

**The initiating and planning phases** are **foundational to the success of the project**, and failure to collaborate effectively adds risk to the project.

The SDLC phases of design and delivery are usually separated into the planning and executing phases and happen sequentially, usually with an approval process between phases. 

#### An Agile lifecycle model is outlined as:
* Vision
* Backlog creation
* Sprint planning
* Sprint execution
* Sprint review 
* Deployment

##### In the Agile model, the SDLC phases of design and deliver align with and are performed during the Agile processes of 
* Sprint planning 
* Sprint execution
* Sprint review

Most Agile project models use these time-constrained periods of focused work called iterations or sprints. During these sprints, the team usually meets daily at the same time and place to discuss their work with each other and collaborate to resolve any impediments that might prevent them from achieving their shared commitment for that time frame.

#### Key professional skills for successful execution of the SDLC
* Communication
* Leadership
* Collaboration
* Accountability

#### Collaboration in different phases of SDLC
The definition, design, and development phases are particularly important as significant business stakeholder input is needed to create a solution that will meet the needs of the business and its LOBs. 
* **Definition phase**. Discussing business needs. Defining the solution and outcomes.
* **Design phase**. Regular discussions between business and technology Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Whiteboard and requirements discussions.
* **Development phase**. Iterative, with technology and business professionals regularly examining the in-progress development and providing feedback on the suitability of the solution.
* **Delivery phase**. Business and technology professionals collaborate to ensure that the completed solution is effectively implemented and that appropriate systems and processes for support and gathering feedback are in place.

### Requirements Management Process
Requirements management process ensures that the product development goals are successfully met. It provides a way to avoid errors by keeping track of changes in requirements and fostering communication with stakeholders from the start of a project throughout the engineering lifecycle.

#### Types of business documents
* **Business plan**. A business plan is a document that is typically directed toward external stakeholders, such as lenders, investors, or a board. The scope of a business plan is centered on the entire company or a business unit and contains sales and bottom-line related forecasts aimed at convincing investors to invest. It can contain details such as financial data on costs, revenues, and margins.
* **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**. A BRD is a document that defines the scope and objectives of assignments that require defined structures and teams. It is used to gain clarity on stakeholder and customer expectations and priorities, and to define the project’s overall objectives. It also serves as a plan that outlines how to address a challenge or problem in the company that may or may not require the help of outside resources. A BRD is effective in solving problems that are not urgent and that require the expertise of multiple people. It can document current business problems and ensure stakeholder alignment before launching the effort.
* **White paper**. A white paper is a conceptual document that usually presents a description of an approach, best practices, or something new that may benefit a business. A white paper is used for presenting ideas, concepts, and new approaches and exploring their feasibility. It is neither specific to a business nor does it usually include recommendations for implementing the practice discussed in the paper. It is simply an exploration of the concept or approach being addressed, including both positive and negative perspectives.
* **Request for Proposal (RFP)**. A Request for Proposal (RFP) defines a specific scope of work from a project, a portion of a project, or even an initiative for vendors to propose and provide a bid for their services. While an RFP has some elements similar to that of other business documents, the focus of this document is on a specific project or section of a project and intended for a vendor rather than an internal stakeholder.

#### Fundamentals of a Business Requirements Document (BRD)
In business, there are a number of key documents that are created and used to help organize, set objectives, goals, scope, requirements, and timelines, and just provide a general direction and focus for a company to follow.

The most commonly known and used documents are business plans, Business Requirements Documents (BRDs), white papers, and Requests for Proposals (RFPs).

When deciding whether a BRD is appropriate or not, it's important to identify the underlying need for its existence. Is it solving the problem or challenge that requires a formal initiative or project?

A BRD is used to help guide stakeholders by providing a clear direction and outlining the specific business objectives that can be accomplished so they align with the overall project or initiative. Additionally, a BRD can be used as a blueprint to set the foundation and structure for the project plan by outlining the specific direction intended for the initiative.

Because a BRD can be used by two different audiences, it is important that it is well written and comprehensive and that the sections are tailored for the intended audiences, such as external stakeholders versus internal project team members. To gain buy-in, it should identify any audience-relevant business challenges that will be solved in the process.

A BRD can go a long way to help clarify the expectations of everyone involved and also make sure that the project or initiative is completed successfully rather than abandoned when new challenges or priorities arise.

#### Need for using a BRD
* The problem may require multiple possible solutions and the organization is unsure of the right solution. 
* The solution will require at least several weeks of effort. 
* The solution requires a team effort. 
* The solution needs a budget and formal schedule to accommodate the expenditure of resources such as time, money, facilities, and more. 
* The effort may interact with and depend on other initiatives. 
* The effort may require vendors for services or products. 
* The solution will result in a considerable benefit to the organization on meeting  goals. 
* The solution will satisfy stakeholder needs. 

#### Benefits of a comprehensive BRD
* Increasing the probability that the project or initiative will be a success.
* Obtaining the necessary resources, such as money and time.
* Getting buy-in from various stakeholder groups, potentially with conflicting priorities.
* Avoiding overlap or conflicts with other ongoing initiatives or projects.
* Clarifying requirements that may eventually be part of an RFP to get help from vendors.

### Project Risk Mitigation

#### Project risk
Project risk is any form of uncertainty that can affect the success of your project. Risk management exists to remove or minimize project risks.

##### Types of risk
* **Operational risk**, or any risk associated with the infrastructure needed to complete a project
* **Human capital risk**, or any risk associated with the people working on a project
* **Execution risk**, or any risk that can occur during the actual execution of project work
* **Financial risk**, or any risk associated with funding a project, capturing revenue from a project, or both
* **Technology risk**, or any risk associated with the technology that supports the project

##### Each type of risk as putting pressure on the project's 
* timeline
* scope
* budget
* project's quality.

##### The types of risk overlap

#### Every project has three fumdamental stages:
* Plan
* Execute
* Close

Whether the stages overlap or not, risk mitigation occurs in all three stages. 

In the planning stage, you identify, assess, classify, and prioritize risk. You can classify risk as low risk, moderate risk, or high risk depending on the risk's impact on the project. You then develop a plan to address that risk.

In the execute and close stages, you **monitor, communicate, escalate, and mitigate the risk**. Monitoring means using tools and techniques to sustain risk awareness across the entire team. 

Bottom line: in risk mitigation, you first identify and prioritize risk, and have a plan to address it if it occurs.

### Knowledge Check
* **Project stakeholders**. The project charter identifies the project stakeholders or the individuals or groups affected by the project. The charter conveys the rationale for the project and its estimated value to ensure a common understanding by everyone involved.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**. The WBS is a framework that lists the deliverables needed to complete the project and states who owns each deliverable. In general, the WBS lists the first 25 to 30% of the project work.
* **Preliminary cost estimate budget**. Budgets are prepared in two stages, preliminary cost estimate, followed later by a final cost estimate. A preliminary cost estimate is used when there is little time or limited information and is prepared using data from similar projects or historical cost data. Upon completion, a preliminary cost estimate budget typically has a 20 to 50% variance from the actual cost of the project.
* **Require a selection of a best approach or solution among multiple courses of action**. A BRD would be a good choice in situations where there may be several alternative courses of action to address a problem and the organization is not sure of the best approach. A BRD would probably not be the best approach if a problem is minor and may correct itself without any further action. A BRD would also not depend on whether the problem is handled by you or another department or unit. If a problem is urgent and needs to be solved immediately, it is probably not appropriate to take the time to write a BRD.    
* **Identify, assess, classify, and prioritize risk**. In the planning stage, you identify, assess, classify and prioritize risk. You can classify risk as low risk, moderate risk, or high risk depending on the risks impact on the project, and develop a plan to address that risk.

### Summary
* Project management is essential for cloud developers as it helps define project scope, allocate resources effectively, manage time and schedules, mitigate risks, facilitate collaboration, and maintain quality. 
* The project management lifecycle consists of the initiating, planning, implementing, and monitoring phases.
* The cloud developers can create a project plan (scope, schedule, and budget) and use it to successfully implement the project. 

## Agile Project Management

### Pre-assessment
* **A group of methodologies that share focus on responding to change and moving quickly**. Agile can be broadly described as a group of methodologies that focus on flexibility, adaptability, and moving quickly to deliver value. Scrum is a type of agile methodology. Agile is not a certification program for project management.
* **Building a new training facility on a university campus**. The brick-and-mortar project is not a great fit for agile practices because of the scale and long service life of the campus building. There is a need for advanced planning to achieve economies of scale. Waterfall is a better choice for such projects.
* **People who have a vested interest in a project’s result**. User stories are short, straightforward statements relating to the outcome of the agile project. Anyone in the organization can contribute a user story, but they're typically submitted by people who have a vested interest in the project's result.
* **Done**. The Project team, as a unit, must establish a clear definition of Done early in the project. In general, Done is when all acceptance criteria for a user story or other Product Backlog Items are met, which can be tricky because each individual user story has its own set of acceptance criteria. Also, over time, teams may refine their original definition of Done.
* **For the team to determine what it could do in the next sprint to improve as a team**. A Sprint retrospective meeting is conducted after the Sprint review to discuss the areas of improvement before beginning the next sprint. A Sprint Retrospective should only take about an hour and involves the scrum master and the team. The product owner is optional, but encouraged to attend, and ideally no business leaders are present.

### Benefits of Agile Project Management
Agile encourages frequent communication and feedback among team members, allowing for quick adjustments and adaptations as needed. This iterative process enables teams to respond to changes, challenges, and customer feedback more effectively.

There are four Agile values that define the mindset that all Agile teams should strive for:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

#### Agile project management
Agile project management is an iterative approach often utilized in new product development, product enhancements, or other internal company projects that are typically delivered through a project management process. Agile project management is 
* highly flexible
* interactive
* serviceable for quick turnaround.

In this approach, each project is completed through a series of short phases, or lifecycles, called **sprint**s, which typically last no longer than **two weeks**.

Each sprint begins with a planning meeting, and once the sprint is underway, teams meet daily for a quick status of the project and to assess progress. This meeting is also called the daily scrum, which provides a simple framework for teams to work together collaboratively. 

The scrum master is a process specialist who acts as a coach and facilitates the daily scrums to keep the team on task. After completing each sprint, the project team conducts a sprint review and determines the requirements for the next sprint.

Because sprints empower teams to make decisions quickly, the Agile approach does not work well in organizations that use long decision-making or approval processes.

Sprints also require intense cross-functional collaboration to be successful.

Agile project management works well for companies that operate in fast-paced, complex development environments. 

Agile project management is also ideal when project requirements are fluid and likely to change before project completion.

##### Key benefit of Agile project management
* Quickly responding to project-related issues

##### Other benefits
* Efficient risk management. Because scrum meetings occur daily, issues can be identified early and addressed quickly, thus minimizing exposure.

Agile teams that cooperate, collaborate, and are empowered to make project decisions are highly motivated and high performing.

### Benefits of an Agile business environment

#### Increased collaboration across teams
A strong foundation of collaboration and a culture of mobilizing and responding quickly allows teams to anticipate and respond better to client needs.

The cross-functional Agile teams focus on the client by investing heavily in product development, market research, and technology capabilities that inform their corporate strategy.

This approach enables them to create better client experiences earlier in the product development life cycle. They use design thinking to uncover new capabilities for future retirees that emphasize client needs and open a new target market for younger clients.

#### Improving employee engagement
As part of the initiative to improve employee engagement, the Agile transformation team collects data and feedback from employees through engagement surveys.

In areas where an Agile mindset is already in place, they find higher employee engagement due to the new focus on culture, servant leadership, continuous learning, and improved work practices around innovation and ownership.

#### Improving productivity and efficiency 
Clients in other industries also benefit from Agile transformation through improved efficiency and productivity. 

##### Chemical Industry
Plastics and Metals (P&M) Inc. is a company based out of Germany. After the European Union (EU) established environmental regulations limiting use and wastage of plastic, P&M was looking for environment-friendly ways to reduce prototyping.

With the Agile approach, they now experiment with plastic and metal 3D printers, which has reduced their prototyping time from 12 weeks to 12 hours. This has improved P&M’s overall productivity and efficiency.

##### Oil and Gas Industry
ArkRig is an arctic oil and gas exploration company. Its biggest problem before adopting Agile principles was the time it took to drill oil wells. It took on an average of 10 days to drill, due to improper planning, the need to reconfigure drill strings, and downtime caused by extreme weather conditions. 

Additionally, ArkRig faced high employee turnover, and lack of transparency and clarity in their documentation and standards. These challenges negatively impacted not just the revenues of the company, but also the motivation level of the employees and the strategic goals of the organization.

With Agile, ArkRig has standardized drilling procedures based on unique well conditions. As a result, they have reduced their drilling time to six days and reduced drilling costs by 30%. They are also more responsive to disruptions caused by poor weather conditions and have reduced downtime significantly. 

#### Adopting new processes and technology 
Transforming your organization to have more dynamic and stable work practices, along with the constant introduction of innovative technology such as machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics will positively impact your process, whether manufacturing, software development, consulting, or any other industry. Here's how ArkRig has adopted Agile processes and new technology.

##### IoT sensors
The company is now using IoT sensors to remotely track [the] health of their machinery and assets in the field, and they use robots to perform dangerous repair work in bad weather.

##### Employee training
The company is providing their employees with training to use these new technologies, which has a positive impact on productivity and efficiency. 

##### Standards and documentation
The company has simplified drilling standards and has reduced their documentation from 1,000 pages to fewer than 100 pages. This approach eliminates manual, mundane processes, and improves job satisfaction. 

#### Ensuring better collaboration and transparency
For organizations with diverse, global teams, focusing on a common language, designing meeting formats for collaboration and output rather than just open discussion, and including sprint techniques all improve the Agile work environment. 

Agile facilitates interaction and communication, rapid iteration, input, and creativity while fragmented and segmented working does not.

### Agile methodologies
Most Agile methodologies use short time-boxed iterations of focused work, often called sprints.
* Extreme Programming (XP)
* Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Kanban
* Hybrid Methodologies
* Scaling Approaches

Agile methodologies enable a company to respond quickly and effectively to changes. Within Agile, there are specific approaches that share many values and processes. The most important common values are teamwork combined with a focus on **delivering value to the organization rapidly and frequently**.

Agile project management describes a set of:
* methods
* techniques
that help project teams and organizations do the same thing: go fast yet respond quickly to change. 

Agile methods are
* iterative
* adaptive
* interactive
* value teams and teamwork.

#### Scrum
Scrum is an Agile methodology that originated from software development but is used across applications including new product development, healthcare, and education.

##### Scrum teams use three roles, three processes, and three artifacts as the framework for organizing and performing work.

##### The three roles are:
* The scrum master
* The team
* The product owner

##### The processes are:
* Sprint planning
* The daily standup meeting or daily scrum
* The sprint review, which includes a demo of what the team did along with a retrospective of their performance and how to improve

##### The three artifacts are
* The product or project backlog
* The sprint backlog
* A visual tool such as a burn-down chart, burn-up chart, or a scrum board used by the team to see their progress during a sprint.

The scrum master leads the team and scrum practices and helps them self-organize. At the sprint's end, the team shows the product owner work completed. The product owner reviews, accepts, or rejects the work. The team reviews the positive or negative aspects and practices to keep or change during the next sprint. The team takes this information into their next sprint planning session, which ensures they can iteratively and continuously improve. 

#### Extreme Programming (XP)
XP is a software development methodology that focuses on building a minimum viable product, and then iterating and adding to it. XP is known for its emphasis on customer satisfaction, frequent small releases, and collaborative team dynamics.

Extreme programming, XP, is an Agile methodology that shares many practices with scrum, such as the focus on short work cycles and frequent releases. XP also shares common Agile values such as being iterative, adaptive, and interactive. As it can be inferred from the name, XP is a software development-focused methodology.

XP uses paired programming, two programmers working together at one computer. This XP practice enables the programmers to collaborate, talking about how to code and implement a feature and checking and testing their work in real-time. XP focuses on getting something built—a minimum viable product—and then iterating and adding to it.

##### There is intense focus on testing at
* The unit level
* The feature level
* The functional level

XP teams conduct long testing sessions called **testathons**, in which the team focuses exclusively on exhaustive testing and fixing of defects. It is worth noting that iterations in XP may be allowed to run longer than the typical two-or four-week iteration in scrum, with iterations as long as **six weeks**.

#### Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
FDD is an iterative and incremental software development process that is particularly well-suited for large and complex software projects. It is a part of the Agile software development family and focuses on delivering software features in a systematic and organized manner.

FDD shares some practices with scrum as well as basic Agile values.

FDD is generally used on software development projects.

Feature-driven development starts with an object model and feature list. The project is planned based on delivering feature sets. Once outlined, the team then focuses on designing, building, testing, and delivering each feature.

##### Difference from scrum
* Projects and teams using FDD may have iterations of varying lengths depending on the size of the feature they are working on. Shorter is better. For example, an iteration for a simple feature might be two days, while a more complex feature might go two weeks. 
* Documentation. There is more emphasis on documenting features than with scrum or XP. Since the project is driven by the architecture and model designed by the team, there is more upfront design work prior to development than with scrum or XP.

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
TDD is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing the actual code or functionality. It is a key practice within the Agile development approach and is known for its ability to improve code quality, maintainability, and reliability.

#### Kanban
Kanban is a visual project management and workflow management method. The primary objective of Kanban is to visualize work, limit work in progress (WIP), and continuously improve the flow of work through the system.

Applied to product or software development, Kanban is used by project teams to manage their backlog of work and limit work in progress to their capacity.

Project teams pull from the backlog only when they have capacity and when the project process indicates the need for the work to be done. In this approach, work does not stall in progress, waiting for a team member to become available. 

Unlike scrum, Kanban does not use sprints, but it does require self-organized teams and emphasizes flexibility and adapting to change. Meetings are held as needed to respond to changes, impediments, and other aspects of the project.

#### Hybrid project methodologies
* Agile Fall
* Scrumban

##### Agile Fall
Organizations and project teams will adapt processes from Agile or scrum with waterfall processes to suit the needs of their organization and projects. This adaptation is usually based on the need for innovation, risk tolerance, and the organization's culture. Organizations with low-risk tolerance and less need for innovation tend toward more waterfall and less Agile. Flatter organizations comfortable with more risk and with a need for rapid innovation will use more Agile elements in their hybrid.

##### Scrumban
uses scrum processes to organize and do the work while using Kanban methods to seek continual improvement.

#### Frameworks for scaling Agile practices
* LeSS - large-scale Scrum
* SAFe - The Scaled Agile Framework

##### aLarge-Scale Scrum - LeSS
LeSS maintains the core practices of scrum while providing a framework to scale product and software development without losing the benefits of the scrum process. LeSS can be effective in environments scaling multiple teams, with approximately **eight scrum teams*** considered an upper limit.

LeSS takes a more open approach to leveraging its scaling practices. 

##### Scaled Agile Framework (SAFE)
This approach suggests more structure and process than LESS. SAFE is described as a software development framework that extends Agile to enterprise-scale applications. SAFE has more structure, accompanying documentation, and even certifications associated with its practice. 

Use of either approach requires additional reading and training, and organizations thinking of scaling any Agile approach should invest in training their managers and teams. Agile methodologies help an organization adapt quickly to change. 

#### Implementation of Agile project management
Agile methods may not be suited to all projects, so it is necessary to implement Agile only on suitable projects. In addition to unsuitable projects, Agile implementation can be hampered by impediments, such as lack of leadership support and unavailable product owners. 

For successful Agile projects, it is vital to ensure that all stakeholders are on board with the methodology and understand the key elements. It is important to ensure the team is committed to the project. Teams with members pulled in various directions or committed to multiple projects rarely make successful Agile team members. A best practice is to adjust variable compensation programs to reward team achievement as opposed to individual achievement.

**The product owner** is particularly critical to a successful Agile project. 

##### The product owner should be:
* available
* fully allocated
* versed in the information or knowledge necessary to guide the team.

It is important that senior leadership supports the use of the Agile methodology and also understands the iterative nature of the planning ensuring dedicated team members, a fully engaged product owner and supportive and informed leadership are all reliable best practices for running successful Agile projects.

When the environment into which the product or project deliverables are being released is changing rapidly, Agile methods can help the organization and project team maintain pace with the changes through quick and iterative releases.

Some organizations and project types are not a good fit for the use of Agile as a project management methodology. Organizations with layered hierarchical structures and bureaucracies are not likely to find Agile a workable project management approach.

#### Cases when Agile project approaches do not suit 
* Projects, where the deliverable has a very long service life, shipbuilding, power plants, large buildings, and bridges, are not as suited to use of Agile methods, scenarios where change is not desirable once the plan is fixed and the project is underway or not suited to Agile methods.
* The project's scale demands a lot of planning and there are many benefits from the savings that come from committing to large material orders. 
* The necessity of identifying and contracting a large long-term labor force to deliver the project.

#### Agile methods can be affected by various impediments within organizations
* When leadership believes that Agile methods will fix or overcome longstanding cultural or organizational problems.
* A lack of leadership support for the changes that Agile needs to be successful.
* The failure to reward teams for working together to meet commitments versus rewarding individual heroics.
* Ineffective or unavailable product owners.
* A lack of solid common training.

#### Agile artifacts and metrics
Agile projects use artifacts, metrics, discipline to track progress, enabling accountable teams to plan and deliver business value predictably and regularly through metrics and visual tools.

To track progress, Agile projects use specific artifacts and metrics combined with rigor and discipline contrary to some early misconceptions. This in turn enables accountable Agile teams to plan and deliver measurable business value. Predictably and regularly, teams can plan an Agile release using metrics and visual tools, which also help in tracking the project's progress.

##### Backlog Grooming into an artifact - product or project backlog
Creating a wish list of desired features. Agile teams, product owners, and other stakeholders work together to review and refine this wish list of features.

**This backlog becomes the basis for planning** the entire Agile project through a series of sprints or feature sets that make up the release.

The Agile project team, product owner, and scrum master or Agile project manager refine a vision and a basic wish list into something that is **actionable**. That is, that the team can break down further into artifacts such as user stories and tasks, which then form the basis of release planning, sprint and feature planning, and the team's daily work.

The process of backlog grooming is where the Agile team discusses each backlog item, asks questions, and learns more about each item. This is done at the start of the project and then done iteratively throughout the project as each sprint or feature set is completed. This results in a backlog that is prioritized based on value and dependencies, as well as an evolving improvement of what is really needed from each backlog item.

Grooming further refines the wish list into a backlog of items consisting of user stories. The user story is an important artifact in many Agile methodologies. The user story enables the product owner to describe what is needed in a common format. It enables the team to discuss the desired outcome of the user story and translate it into requirements, refined features and tasks that must be performed to deliver the user story and the feature. The user story may take various forms, but a common form often used is as some kind of actor or role. "I want a feature or capability so that I can use it to do something that provides me value." An example is "As an online banking customer, I want to log into the banking system to access my accounts."

##### Epics
Some preliminary backlog items may be too large to be called user stories. These items are often called epics. Before these epics can be planned and worked, they must be further refined into smaller pieces.

##### Story points scaling
There are many benefits of breaking the backlog down into user stories. One way of doing this is to size and estimate these user stories and features using some kind of relative sizing scale. It is important that the team sizes the stories relative to one another. To do this, most teams create a story point scale and size their work using this scale. The story points help with capacity planning.

##### Velocity
Velocity measures how much work the team is delivering in each sprint. The velocity metric in the process of using it for tracking and planning enables iterative refinement of the overall release plan.

Teams commit to a specific number of story points in each sprint and then they measure their output after each sprint and track it. This in turn enables the team to predict their capacity and delivery speed with progressively better accuracy and reliability. 

##### Backlog review
After each sprint, the team reviews the backlog, uses their experience to update their sizing estimates, and then calculates how long it may take to complete the remaining work. Alternatively, they will use the same process to determine how much work can be delivered in the time remaining before the project must be completed.

##### Sprint planning
Sprint planning is where the Agile team brings everything together to plan a specific increment of work that they will commit to and execute during that sprint. The process of backlog grooming and user story creation done in close collaboration with the product owner who is responsible for setting priorities, provides the team with a specific set of prioritized work for that sprint.

##### Sprint backlog
The product owner and the scrum master or Agile project manager will have worked with the team during the previous sprint to identify the work items that should be ready to bring into the next sprint. In sprint planning, the team evaluates this short list of items, known as the sprint backlog. They update their story point estimates, further, break down any stories that are too big, and then break the stories into tasks that can be estimated in hours.

The team uses this task breakdown and the estimation of task in hours as a sanity check to ensure they have the capacity to do the work they are committing to. 

The team and product owner review the groomed backlog of user stories and features to determine which features are of highest value to the project's outcome. The team subject matter experts advise on mandatory dependencies, high-risk work, and any research or prototyping work that must happen early in the release to enable decisions or to lower risk for subsequent sprints.

The team organizes the user stories according to the highest value risk and prototyping needs. They organize the work into iterations, often called sprints. These sprints are of a fixed time frame. Two weeks and four weeks are typical sprint lengths.

##### Feature Driven Development
For feature driven development, the team organizes the release by feature sets using the same criteria of highest value risk and prototyping or research if necessary. The iterative nature of Agile means that as each sprint or feature set is developed, the team and the organization apply the learnings to the remainder of the project. This informs revisions of the release plan, whether the length of the planned release, the number of features that will fit into a time boxed release or the overall scope of the project or product that will be delivered.

##### An Agile Project metrics
* Velocity - how much work the team can complete in future sprints and therefore determines how long it will take to complete the remaining work in the release backlog.

###### Visual tools used by Agile Projects
* burn down charts - how much work is remaining in the sprint or release and provide a visual representation of the rate at which they are burning down the work they committed to.
* burn up charts - show the progress of the team's completed work and can also show the rate at which work is added to the backlog.
* scrum or task boards - track user stories and related tasks.

Agile projects and teams use specific artifacts and metrics to incrementally plan and deliver measurable business value. The backlog forms the basis for overall release planning and provides the source of user stories and requirements for the team to further refine and plan. Teams use user stories to describe the feature and capability to be delivered and provide a way to size and compare the stories to each other.

User stories are organized into sprints or feature sets based on business value and other priorities. This organization of stories leads to the first version of the release plan. Once the plan is implemented, the progress can be tracked through tools such as burn down charts, burn up charts, and scrum and task boards.

#### Common Agile artifacts
* Product backlog - a prioritized list of user stories, features, and requirements.
* Sprint backlog - a subset of the product backlog items selected for a specific sprint.
* Burndown chart - represent the progress of the team during a sprint.
* Kanban board - representation of the workflow, often using columns and cards.

### Agile Roles and Processes
Agile teams are self-managing with much autonomy over how they organize themselves and how they perform the work that they commit to. Ideally, an Agile team is a small committed team between five and nine members and fully committed to the project. Competing projects and priorities can reduce an Agile team's effectiveness and make it difficult to establish reliable velocity and capacity metrics.

#### Scrum Master roles
* **is not to assign or direct work**
* coaches
* guides
* helps the team deliver results through use of the scrum framework and practices
* work with product owners and stakeholders to ensure the backlog of work is regularly reviewed, refined, and prioritized.

#### Agile project manager
* Servant leadership - removing impediments, ensuring the team has everything they need, and enabling the team to focus on their commitments.
* handle familiar tasks such as status, reporting upward, and feeding information to their organization's project governance structure and system.
* work with product owners and stakeholders to ensure the backlog of work is regularly reviewed, refined, and prioritized.

#### Product Owner (PO) 
* responsible for knowing and communicating the project's vision and priorities.
*  setting priorities to ensure the project team is working on the highest value work.
* works with customers, stakeholders, and subject matter experts to identify with certainty what features are needed to ensure the project's return on investment and how those features should be delivered.
* asks questions and in turn, answers questions for the team in real time. 
* makes the final decision at the end of each sprint as to whether the work meets objectives and can be considered complete.
* reviews the accumulated results of each sprint through the progress of the release plan and ultimately decides when the release is complete.
* sometimes is a customer, a key stakeholder, or a sponsor.

#### Agile Coach
* works across all other roles and across multiple teams to help organizations and their teams continuously improve their use of Agile practices

The visioning process creates a wish list of initial features called the product backlog. Backlog grooming is a process repeated throughout the project's lifecycle. The process includes continuous refinement of features and requirements and the addition or deletion of features as the project evolves. This process includes prioritization to ensure the team works on highest value items. This process enables the team to perform two other key planning processes:
* release planning 
* Sprint planning 

#### Release Planning
The release planning process enables the product owner and team to plan out sprints in a way that ensures they work on the right things at the right time and that the project delivers expected value. 

#### Project vision process
* yields a backlog that is groomed and shaped into an initial release plan of prioritized work. 
* The next step in the lifecycle is the iteration or sprint. Sprints are usually time boxed and focus on selected items from the backlog.

#### Another approach is to focus on a specific feature set
* the iteration length can vary

#### Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycle
* Plan
* Do
* Check
* Improve

Most Agile methods use some type of time constrained and iterative approach to planning and executing work following a Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycle.

**Scrum** is one of the best known and frequently used frameworks in technology projects. 

#### Benefits of using Agile Methodology
* ongoing iterative nature of planning work, doing work, showing work and checking that work, and then reviewing the team's work practices results in a **cycle of continuous improvement**. 
* This continuous improvement then manifests in improved and more accurate estimating of work, better performance of work, improved cohesion of the team, and ultimately increased throughput and faster delivery of quality work.
* increased speed of delivery, improved accuracy of estimating, and rapid value delivery with increasing quality as desired outcomes of Agile practices.

Agile project teams follow a cycle of continuous planning, working analysis, and improvement to get better and faster, all while ensuring that the quality of their work also improves.

#### Role of product owners in Agile project management
* Defining and prioritizing the product backlog
* Representing the customer and stakeholders
* Making decisions and providing clarity
* Ensuring focus on value and Return on Investment (ROI)
* Facilitating collaboration and communication
* Providing iterative feedback and adaptation

Agile projects leverage constant iterative learning and improvement which relies upon constant and iterative collaboration within the project team and with a business representative, the product owner. This ongoing collaborative learning enables Agile teams to adapt to their own experiences in delivering the project, as well as adapt to any changes posed by changing customer or business needs. 
##### Retrospectives - a way to exercise iterative collaboration model
* regular reviews and demonstrations of their output and through regular reviews of their own team practices

Retrospectives give the team an opportunity to examine their own work practices and make any necessary adjustments immediately rather than at the end of the project. This iterative collaboration model relies upon and assumes shared commitment and highly professional interactions within the team and with other stakeholders. 

##### Professional skills enabling iterative collaboration
* communication
* leadership
* collaboration
* accountability

Collaboration and shared accountability enable Agile teams to function effectively and deliver value to the overall business, specific LOBs and their customers. The role of a product owner in Agile projects is critical and has great influence on the success or failure of projects that use Agile frameworks.

#### Effectiveness of product owners in Agile environment

##### Four common product owner role failures that negatively impact Agile teams and their projects
1. Failure to lead on backlog grooming. 
2. Failure to maintain good and consistent customer and stakeholder relationships.
3. Failure to be readily available to the team to provide critical information, direction, and feedback. 
4. Failure to be alert for and recognize when completed increments of product could result in readiness to release product or deploy new functionality to production.

##### Negative impact of ineffective Product Owner behaviors
* not grooming a backlog results in ineffective Sprint planning sessions.
* cause the team to start sprints late and without a clear sense of the sprint's objective.
* create impediments for their teams and the work of these teams suffers.
* confusion and missed opportunities.
* the project itself can stall.

##### Best practices for product owners
* **Groom the backlog**. The product owner should get into regular meetings with the scrum master to convert the product manager's requirements and customer interests into actionable user stories and features. These can be used in sprint planning or even pulled forward when Sprints go better than expected. 
* **Maintain relationships**. The product owner's relationships with the product managers and knowledge of the customers help to groom and prioritize the backlog and support the project team during their sprints. 
* **Ensure availability**. The product owner should manage their schedule and proactively communicate it to the team so that when the team has questions or needs direction on a user story or feature, they are available.
* **Drive value realization**. The product owner should attend sprint reviews, compare output to release plans, and be alert to identify opportunities to release new features and enhancements for the product. This will lead to rapid and consistent value realization.

#### Relation between product owners and other stakeholders

#### Key relashionships of Product Owner with
* customers
* Agile teams
* stakeholders
* scrum masters 

A product owner must work closely, constantly, and continuously with stakeholders and customers inside and outside of the organization to maintain a consistent and intimate familiarity with their needs and interests. This is necessary so that the product owner can groom the backlog, prioritize and provide guidance to the Agile project team based on this always
up-to-date knowledge.

Each key relationship that the product owner must maintain has a critical impact on the success of Agile teams and projects. In Agile environments, product owners maintain a good relationship with customers and stakeholders to be aware of their requirements and priorities. They frequently engage with customers and stakeholders to understand the expectations and determine if there is any change in the priorities. They use this knowledge to efficiently guide teams by providing relevant inputs and prioritizing work to ensure that the teams are always on track and in position to meet their commitments. A product owner who fails to maintain good relations with customers, stakeholders, and teams can negatively impact organization and stakeholder relationships, project outcomes, and ultimately an organization's success.

### Agile Scrum Approach
Scrum is an Agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices. 

#### Agile is
* rapid
* iterative
* collaborative

Scrum is effective for delivering software projects in a rapidly changing environment and provides both flexibility and transparency. Because scrum involves frequent inspection, it's a catalyst for progress and allows for quick adjustments. 

#### The key roles in scrum:
* **The product owner** manages the product backlog, the prioritized list of everything the project needs. He also accepts the work increments as they complete.
* **The scrum master** facilitates scrum events and helps the team self-organize. However, the scrum master **is not the team leader and does not have authority** over the development team.
* **The development team**. Each team member is accountable for and committed to delivering the expected results. 

Sprint cycles typically last between one and four weeks.

#### Daily status meeting called the daily scrum or stand up
This meeting lasts only fifteen minutes and a scrum master ensures this. In the stand up, each person shares:
* What he or she did yesterday
* What he or she will do today
* And what, if anything, is blocking progress

When a sprint concludes, the team holds a sprint review meeting to check and approve completed work. It also makes any needed adjustments to the project.

After sprint review, the team plans the next sprint using the updated backlog. At the end of each sprint, the team also meets for the sprint retrospective. Here, the team reviews its process, documents lessons learned and applies this knowledge during the next sprint. This improves the current project and provides a knowledge base for future Agile scrum projects. 

#### Examples of benefits of using Scrum
* Increased workforce productivity
* Higher product quality
* Less waste
* Shorter time to market
* Improved team collaboration
* Increased employee stakeholder and customer satisfaction

### User stories
User stories are short, straightforward statements relating to the outcome of the Agile project. These stories are clear, concise, and immediately actionable.

Anyone in the organization can contribute a user story, but they're typically submitted by people who have a vested interest in the project's result. 

Many Agile teams hold a story-writing workshop after kickoff, and the stories refined during the workshop become items on the product backlog. A user story follows the following format:

User stories may also come from the Agile team members themselves, stemming from their knowledge of the project's big picture.

"As <**type of user**>, I want <**this function**> so I can <**perform this action**>"

#### A user story sample for a **Customer**
As <**a customer**>, I want <**to log into my account**> so I can <**access my account information**>.

#### A user story sample for a **Account Manager**
As <**an account manager**>, I want <**customer specific price lists**> so I can <**offer customers their entitled pricing**>.

Teams begin collecting user stories soon after the project start and continue to collect them as the project progresses. Many Agile teams hold a story writing workshop event after kickoff, and the stories refined during the workshop become items on the product backlog. Some teams also rely on a definition of ready. In general, user stories that meet a team's definition of ready are clear, concise, and immediately actionable. That is, the product owner should place only stories that are truly ready on the product backlog. 

#### The three C's of user stories by Agile expert Ron Jeffries
* The card itself 
* The conversation
* The confirmation

The card is also a physical reminder to have the conversation. Teams gather additional details about each story through conversations between the product owner and the team to refine everyone's understanding of the user story and its expected value. 

When you participate in a user story conversation, always have the physical card with you, and don't be afraid to mark it up. Flip it over and list all acceptance criteria. The product owner indicates if the item is high priority and provides cost estimates if available. 

User story confirmation occurs when you conduct the acceptance tests that determine whether your project meets all acceptance criteria. Testing can and should be performed by anyone on the team—the developers, the user who submitted the story, or a quality assurance analyst.

#### The aspect of Story Point Estimating
An important aspect of user stories is what occurs before a story moves into implementation, the aspect of story point estimating. This estimation typically occurs during sprint planning, which we'll discuss later. A story point is a unit of measure assigned by the project team to size user stories relative to each other. These values should consider risk, effort, duration, and complexity in a single value. Teams often use a modified Fibonacci scale such as 1,2,3,5,8,1,3,2,0,4,100. On this scale, tasks given a one are simple, and pretty much everyone agrees on this. From there, discussion centers around how much more involved than one a task is. For example, is the item a 5 up the scale from one or more like a 13?

This relative value helps minimize overanalysis by providing perspective.

Teams may also use t-shirt sizes such as extra small up through XXL. 

##### Planning Poker - technique based on the Delphi method and promoted by industry expert Mike Cohn
In a planning poker session, each team member has their own deck of planning poker cards with values reflecting the team's story point scale. The product owner, scrum master or a team member reads a user story prompting conversation about the item.

After discussing the item and asking questions, each team member chooses a card representing their estimate and places it face down. Once everyone decides, the team reveals their cards. If all estimates are the same, that becomes the estimate and the players move on to the next story. If the estimates vary, further discussion takes place and team members with the highest and lowest estimates explain their rationale.

###### The benefits of using planning poker include:
* Sharing multiple expert opinions before making estimations
* Having conversations that lead to the discovery of missing information
* Increasing the accuracy of the estimates, thereby decreasing the level of risk

For each user story, make an initial estimation. If an item requires discussion, spend a few minutes and then do a second estimation. After that, move on. You'll likely return to the item later when you have a better idea of how much work is involved. 

#### Sprints
##### The five Scrum events
* The sprint itself
* Sprint planning
* Daily scrum
* Sprint review
* The sprint retrospective

Within a sprint, work is planned based on the historical capacity of the team. It might help to think of each sprint as a mini-project, with planning, execution, delivery, closing, and a retrospective all wrapped into this bite-sized package.

#### Sprint planning
The sprint planning meeting includes the product owner, scrum master, and the project team.

The product owner, amasses a collection of user stories written on index cards. These items are now part of the product backlog, along with other technical requirements and specifications. 

A key decision to make at the initial sprint planning meeting is how long each sprint will last. 

At this point, the team verifies the sizes of the selected user stories and divides each story into its component tasks to finish planning the sprint. At the end of each sprint, the product owner should accept all items on the sprint backlog and mark them complete.

##### Stand-up
During the sprint, the team gathers every day for the stand up or daily scrum. This meeting lasts only 15 minutes and everyone should actually stand up to ensure it stays brief. 

The daily scrum is where each team member shares what they did yesterday, what they will do today, and what, if anything, is blocking their progress. By sharing what was accomplished the previous day the whole team knows exactly what work is done and what more is left to do and by communicating what work is planned for that day, a team member is making a commitment to the other members, a promise to be accountable for their assigned tasks. 

When team members share an impediment they experience during the Sprint, the team works together to try to solve it. The scrum master will also jump in if needed to remove the impediment.

**The daily scrum** provides several important benefits for the team, including:
* Synchronization—Everyone on the team is on the same page regarding the sprint's progress
* Early identification of obstacles blocking progress
* Early identification of errors
* The opportunity to make timely corrections
* Greater integration
* Motivation and accountability of team members, and
* Promotion of the self-organizing team concept highlighting it as a strength of the scrum methodology

At the end of each sprint, the product owner should accept all items on the sprint backlog and mark them complete. 

#### Sprint Completion and Review
When all acceptance criteria for a user story or other product backlog items are met, a project is considered "Done". The team, as a unit, must establish a clear definition of "Done" early in the project.

In general, done is when all acceptance criteria for a user story or other product backlog items are met, which can be tricky because each individual user story has its own set of acceptance criteria. 

Also, over time, teams may refine their original definition of done.

##### Example of "DONE" definition
* Coding is complete
* The code was tested
* The product owner accepted the deliverable

##### Re-defining "DOME"
* Coding is complete and checked into the software library
* The code was tested
 1. Unit testing
 2. Integration testing
 3. Performance testing
* The product owner accepted the deliverable
* The feature has been documented

#### Technical Debt
Technical debt is a software development term for the implied cost of rework resulting from implementing a quick-fix solution. The quick solution allows you to complete a deliverable in a hurry rather than choose a better solution that takes longer to implement.

For example, issues that arise from early coding problems may result in your website being down for maintenance, leading to inconvenienced, unhappy customers. **Technical debt** is one cause of **missed deadlines and late project delivery**. 

Agile teams should be diligent in keeping technical debt to a minimum. The goal of Agile is to deliver high quality projects, fast.

#### Sprint Review - Show and Tell
It tells the team has done the work, completed the sprint backlog and is now ready to unveil a potentially shippable product increment.

**The scrum master** arranges the meeting, which should last only an hour or two, and **the product owner** invites additional participants, including:
* Users
* Developers from other projects
* Business leaders
* Other stakeholders

At the meeting, the product owner demos the features completed during the sprint, focusing on the acceptance criteria used and the team's definition of done. 

he demo should simulate a user experience and highlight the business value in addition to showcasing functionality.

After the demo, the product owner answers questions and accepts feedback from participants.

Feedback from a sprint review meeting often includes statements like "I like the search feature, but it makes me think we need a faceted search as well." "The add to cart feature works as designed, but it's not quite what I had in mind. Instead of a two-column home page, what if we tried three columns?"

What's happening here is that you're collecting new user stories. These stories need to be added to the product backlog, prioritized, and estimated. Once that happens, the team can plan the next sprint with the updated product backlog. Continually grooming and refining the product backlog is critical to project success. It ensures that at any given time, the backlog items are relevant contain the appropriate level of detail, and can be easily estimated and help clarify the project's objectives.

##### Sprint review offers some important benefits
* Increased team motivation and morale from seeing results in a short amount of time.
* Enhanced collaboration and team building.
* Higher levels of stakeholder engagement.
* Visible responsiveness to customers.
* Confidence and trust from business leaders.
* Demonstration of the value of Agile methodology to the business. 
#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 
A scrum master or product owner is always making sure that the team is building potentially releasable increments of the solution or product. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the version of a new product, which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.

Gathering insights from an MVP enables quicker feedback from users than developing a full-featured product that may not be 100% tested or secure. An example of an MVP could be a landing page for your website or a “buy now” button that doesn't do anything other than register that someone has clicked it.

An MVP allows testing an idea with potential customers while avoiding the time and expense of developing a finished product that may not appeal to the market as much as he thinks. Having an MVP also limits risk because it allows determine how users view the product by providing just enough functionality and features to evaluate it. While an MVP can resemble a final product, it starts as the most basic version of the product that can be released. Its purpose is to provide just enough value to satisfy early adopters while also eliciting their feedback on which features should be added to or removed from the final version. The MVP process is also iterative to allow changes until the desired final product is achieved.

##### An MVP provides three main benefits
1. An MVP replaces assumptions with insights from customers on the features they like or dislike. This provides the information that brand managers require to make an informed decision on whether to proceed with the product as planned, alter it, or abandon it. 
2. An MVP is a less expensive way to develop a product because it has the least amount of features and functionality required for product launch. Analyzing the feedback obtained from the MVP before creating the final version of the app to avoid both **development costs** and **the costs of an attention-getting rollout**. 
3. Products can be gradually modified and developed into final products. Compared to a completed product, users are told that the MVP is an **initial version**. And that they can offer feedback that contributes to product improvements and how the final version is created.

#### Drawbacks with an MVP
1. Even if the MVP is clearly identified as an **initial version**, customers who want to buy right away may only consider the product's current state and be unwilling to wait for a fully featured final version.
2. Other customers may view the product as **inferior**, causing him to switch to a competitor. 
3. Developing a new product requires substantial expenses and hours of effort.
4. It also involves some risk. Even if market research can estimate a product's potential sales, success is often uncertain. 

An MVP is an effective way to reduce that uncertainty while minimizing risk and limiting costs.

#### Sprint retrospective
The sprint retrospective is a meeting that takes place as soon as possible after the sprint review. The goal of the sprint retrospective is improvement. Scrum retrospectives are workshops or meetings that give project teams time to reflect on a project and brainstorm potential future improvements. 

A sprint retrospective should only take about an hour. Some teams refer to the retrospective as the "Start, Stop, and Continue meeting". The two common Agile metrics used in these meetings are sprint **burn down** and **velocity**. 

##### Roles involved into the Sprint Restrospective 
* The Scrum Master
* The Team
* The Product Owner is optional but encouraged to attend
* ideally **no business leaders** are present due to the self-organizing nature of Agile teams

##### Three main points to focus at the Sprint Restrospective
* What went well?
* What did not go well?
* How can we improve? 

##### Simplified three main points
* **Start**.
* **Stop**.
* **Continue**. 

Then the team determines which specific items they should adopt during the next sprint. The number of items depends on the team's comfort level. The team should select one or two things they can do immediately in the next sprint to improve their performance. After a couple of retrospectives, you should be able to gauge how many new ideas your team can handle. 

##### Benefits from the Sprint Retrospective
* Strengthened team member accountability and commitment
* Increased productivity and efficiency
* Constant refinement of the definition of done
* Continuous overall improvement and reinforcement of the value that self-organizing, Agile teams bring to the business

##### Metrics to determine value and efficiency
* Sprint burn down
* Velocity
* The number of defects discovered during development, after a release or by people external to the project team
* Te number of customer support ticket
* The number of defects postponed to a later release

##### Sprint Burn Down
A sprint burn down report is used to track a team's progress in completion of product backlog items.

The visual is a simple graph with an X & Y axis where the X axis is time and the Y axis is the amount of work to complete. When you reach the end of the sprint, you should have no work left to do.

Pay attention to what the burn down report tells you and make adjustments within your team as needed. Doing so will help the team truly reap the benefits of Agile.

##### Velocity = Speed
Velocity is the amount of work the team completes during a single sprint.

The unit of measure is the same as the unit used during estimation, typically story points or sometimes hours.

On average, it takes three to six sprints before a team's velocity becomes stable. If velocity fluctuates slightly after six weeks, it's usually nothing to worry about, but if it fluctuates widely after six weeks, the team should investigate.

A decrease in velocity may indicate a problem with the team's way of working that they should address at the next retrospective.

While metrics give fantastic quantitative insight, it's important to combine them with the qualitative feedback obtained in sprint retrospective meetings. The key is balance. If teams can achieve some level of balance, they'll continually produce high-quality products quickly in a positive work environment full of organized chaos.

### Dos and Don'ts of Agile Project Management
To maximize the benefits of Agile, teams should continuously learn, adapt, and address these common mistakes. 

#### Missteps and solutions
##### NOT CREATING DEDICATED TEAMS
Organizations should strive to maximize the expertise of their most valuable resources, which is best achieved through dedicated teams. New Agile teams require:
* **focus**,
* **communication**,
* **coordination**, 
* and **availability**. 

If **team members** have competing responsibilities, the team may never get up and running and ultimately fail to launch their project. **Business leaders** must take the lead for ensuring dedicated Agile and scrum project teams. If team members find this isn't happening or that they're pulled away from the project, they should immediately alert the scrum Mmaster. **The scrum master** can then approach the business leaders to advocate for the enforcement of dedicated teams.

##### NOT IDENTIFYING BLOCKERS IN THE SPRINT
As a basic principle of Agile, **the daily scrum** meeting requires team members to share:
* **What they did yesterday**.
* **What they plan to do that day**.
* **What is blocking their progress**. 

###### Possible reasons for NOT SPEAKING
* fear. No one likes finger pointing and if another team member is causing the obstacle, the person with the problem may not want to call out a coworker. But this frustrates the team and inevitably leads to delays and missed deadlines.
* a general lack of communication. Maybe the team has gotten lax and doesn't hold the stand up every day. Teams should recognize that this is a problem and remedy the situation immediately.

The more face to face time the team gets, the better their communication. When team members communicate frequently and become comfortable with each other, they build trust. Team members that trust one another won't be afraid of transparency in their work or naming the impediments in their paths.

##### NOT MAINTAINING RIGOROUS TECHNICAL STANDARDS
Agile is more than just delivering products faster, it's **delivering high-quality products faster**. Teams need to conduct testing in stages, and test until the product meets the required standards.

When it comes to testing **don't wait until the last minute** and **don't skimp**.

Conduct testing in stages such as 
* unit testing, 
* integration testing, 
* and then performance testing. 

Think about what happens during sprint review if the demo crashes during the presentation. The stakeholders are disappointed, the team looks bad, and the business leaders begin to wonder if the investment they made in Agile was worth it. The bottom line, **test early and test often**.

Test until the product meets the conditions of satisfaction and the sprint review demo wows the stakeholders.

##### ASSUMING THE AGILE PROCESS IS EASY
The Agile environment is fast-paced and may appear chaotic, but it requires a culture that supports the development of deep collaboration, concurrent engineering, and self-organizing teams operating with trust and transparency, which can be challenging, but it's effective if done correctly. 

###### Agile involves
* deep collaboration, 
* concurrent engineering, 
* and self-organizing teams operating with trust and transparency.

The Agile environment is fast-paced and may appear chaotic to an outsider and Agile requires a culture that supports the development teams and trusts them to 
* self-organize, 
* make good decisions, 
* and deliver high-quality products. 

Before you begin, gain the support of a business leader or two, Lobby for leadership to invest in some Agile training, and explore the value that Agile brings to an organization that's committed to the methodology.

As you work through starting up an Agile team or improving your existing Agile practices, be aware that mistakes can and do occur. But if you're diligent in ensuring business leader involvement, increasing Agile team face to face time, striving for continual testing, process improvement, and creating a culture that supports an Agile environment, you have the pieces in place to get back on track. 

### Knowledge Check
* **Scrum**. The roles defined are typical of a team using scrum as its project approach. The product owner, team, and scrum master roles are well-defined elements of scrum. TDD and FDD are methodologies that do not use those specific roles. Agilefall is a hybrid approach that leverages elements from other methodologies. 
* **A need for constant strategic input throughout the project life cycle**. Ongoing need for strategic input and the ability to put that input into practice points to a good fit for Agile practices. The other factors all point to waterfall or traditional project management as a better methodology fit.
* **The product owner grooms the product backlog**. The product owner prepares for the planning meeting by grooming the product backlog by:
 * Reviewing the backlog in its entirety and makes certain that each item can be completed during a single sprint. 
 * Prioritizing the items so the team can begin work on the most important tasks. 
* **Participant feedback helps confirm or adjust the overall direction of the project**. At the sprint review meeting, the product owner demos the features completed during the sprint, focusing on the acceptance criteria used and the team's definition of Done. After the demo, the product owner answers questions and accepts feedback from participants which is critical to the project's continued success.
* **How much work is left to complete at a given point in time during a sprint?** Project teams can then track their progress using a Sprint Burn Down report. The visual is a simple graph with an X&Y axis where the X axis is time and the Y axis is the amount of work to complete. When they reach the end of the Sprint, there should be no work left to do.
