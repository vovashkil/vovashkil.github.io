# Sustainability Part 1
## Climate and Carbon
### Pre-assessment
* **Enhancing productivity by reducing waste and resource use**. Sustainability means increasing a system's efficiency, productivity, or capability by reducing unprofitable waste or requiring fewer resources to produce a similar output.
* **Adopting decarbonization and carbon removal and taking leadership on climate action**. Businesses can achieve net-zero emissions by using three levers: decarbonization, carbon removal, and leadership on climate action. While transitioning to renewable energy sources for electricity and heating is one of the ways to reduce emissions, adopting the three levers helps businesses to meet the goal of net-zero emissions.
* **By investing in ESG-focused companies**. Businesses are facing unprecedented pressure from various stakeholders, including investors, insurers, and lenders, as they want to adjust their portfolios toward companies and products that integrate ESG factors into their operations and decision-making processes. Through their buying choices, consumers help create demand shifts for responsible products.
* **Revenue uplift, cost reduction, risk mitigation, and brand recognition**. From a financial perspective, there are several reasons for organizations to embed climate action into their business strategy, including revenue uplift, cost reduction, risk mitigation, and brand recognition. While obtaining carbon credits and incurring less carbon taxes can also result in fiscal benefits, it is not the only financial factor that drives companies to take climate action.
* **Technology can help businesses reduce their carbon emissions and cost of operations**. Technology can equip businesses with crucial analytics and solutions, which can help them reduce their carbon emissions while becoming more cost-effective. While technology can also help businesses make their value chains more agile and switch to renewable energy sources, taking action on climate change requires businesses to make their value chains more responsible and sustainable.

### Significance of Climate Change for Clients and Stakeholders
#### Changing expectations from businesses
Businesses have been slowly adopting sustainable practices in their operations for some time, the urgency of the climate crisis and the joint call to act on climate from most stakeholders is forcing a rethink on the role of businesses in creating value for shareholders, society, and the environment

#### Types of stakeholders and pressure on businesses 
* **Consumers**. They are continuously pushing governments and businesses to act on climate change and issues such as species extinction and inequality.
* **Business-to-business customers**. The idea is to steadily transition toward a green supply chain while cascading sustainability practices all the way down to the lower-tier suppliers.
* **Governments and regulators**. Regulations and standards have slowly prevented businesses from producing certain types of highly harmful pollutants. Now, innovative policies like carbon taxes and cap-and-trade schemes are being implemented to incentivize companies to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs). They do this by putting a price on carbon pollution. Global leaders and decision-makers are also considering how central banks can boost the shift toward clean energy through sustainable financing—the process of considering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) guidelines in investment decisions.
* **Employees**. Actions such as cutting ties with climate-change deniers, committing to zero emissions, discontinuing the use of fossil fuels, and saying no to working with clients who use fossil fuels.
* **Investors, insurers, lenders**. Climate change challenges have become a key concern for many institutional investors who have begun to ask questions about corporate ESG performance and expect them to be reflected in corporate strategy.

#### Creating sustainable value chains 
Businesses today cannot ignore stakeholder pressures to commit to more sustainable ways of conducting business. Instead, they can embrace the opportunities that come from facing climate change challenges head-on.

Fortunately, many corporations are increasingly choosing the latter. These are the companies that are creating innovative and sustainable value chains while still generating profits and having a meaningful, lasting impact on society.

#### Financial reasons to embed climate action 
* **Revenue**. Revenue growth can come from sales uplift from trust and preference by customers, improved access to markets, and differentiated products and services portfolios as a result of sustainable innovation.
* **Cost**. Businesses can save energy, reduce emissions, improve supply chain reliability, and cut R&D costs through collaboration with external stakeholders. For instance, power companies are shifting to green energy, reducing carbon footprint. 
* **Brand**. Building trust, customer loyalty, and social value boosts brand value and attracts talent. Companies benefit from sustainability, and sustainable living brands are growing faster and contributing to overall growth.
* **Risk**. Reputational risk can be mitigated by protecting the business’ “license to operate.” Regular dialogue with regulators can reduce legal risks. The companies can protect their value by considering climate-related changes and taking corresponding actions.

#### Sustainable development goals (SDGs) 
Businesses need to set and achieve targets that adopt the United Nations SDGs. Doing so can help their bottom line while also being essential to helping the planet.

### Strategies for Businesses to Tackle Climate Change
#### Businesses responding to climate change 
While it is true that business activity is a major driver of climate change, business can also be a major force in mitigating climate change and helping us adapt to it.

#### Achieving net-zero emissions
##### Net-zero emissions
* decarbonization
* carbon removal

##### Three levers that businesses can use to reduce their climate impact toward net-zero emissions
* **Decarbonization**. Reducing or replacing carbon emissions today and in the future, for example by using fewer resources, choosing lower or zero-carbon energy sources for production and mobility, reducing carbon embedded in supplies, or developing new low-carbon products or business models.
* **Carbon removal** - the withdrawal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the atmosphere, either through funding offsetting projects that remove carbon elsewhere through human activities such as expanding forests or through direct air capture and storage, a technology that makes it possible to take carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere and store it in materials and other media.
* **Leadership actions** - advocating for more ambitious policies that foster decarbonization in industries and markets and incentivizing suppliers, workforces, and customers to change preferences or behaviors toward more sustainable forms. 

##### Decarbonization across value chains 
Businesses must decarbonize to remove carbon all across their value chains.
* In their supply chain, they can do this by sourcing products and services with a lower carbon footprint.
* Down the value chain, they can incentivize customer behavior, develop new and more circular business models, and reduce emissions from logistics.
* In their operations, they can increase efficiency, switch to renewable energy sources, or design more circular products with lower carbon footprints.

##### Switching to renewable energy sources 
###### Fossil fuels
* coal
* oil
* natural gas

Renewable energy is clean energy. Most forms of renewable energy are net neutral in terms of pollution and environmental impact, and it is increasingly common that renewable sources are the lowest-cost option. Onshore wind and solar power are frequently less expensive than fossil fuel alternatives, and many geographies can generate cost-effective renewable energy without subsidy.

###### Types of renewable energy
* **Wind power** is produced by harnessing air currents, onshore and offshore, with large turbines and converting this energy into electricity.
* **Solar power**. Concentrated solar power and photovoltaics (PV) film technology make it possible to convert sunlight into thermal or photo-electrical energy.
* **Hydroelectricity** uses water in rivers, dams, and other man-made structures to create electricity in hydropower plants. 
* **Geothermal power** is created by capturing and harnessing subsurface heat energy from within the earth.
* **Tidal power**. Wave and tidal power are created by the movement of ocean currents and bodies.
* **Biomethane** (CH4), also called biogas, is produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic material and can be used as a renewable fuel.

###### Leading by example
Businesses are driving tangible value and leading by example by actively pursuing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) developed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.

### Adapting Business Practices for a Sustainable Future
#### The climate challenge
A company can mitigate its climate impact today and in the future by directly decarbonizing its value chain, indirectly by reducing its emissions through offsets, and by using its influence and leadership.

#### Materiality assessment
This is a process where internal and external stakeholders are engaged to help define the areas of climate and broader sustainability impact that matter the most to external stakeholders and to the business. They typically conclude with the creation of a materiality matrix, which helps a business prioritize and select the most urgent areas for action. 

#### The GHG protocol 
The GHG Protocol is a widely used global standard for categorizing, measuring, and reporting GHG emissions. 

##### How does it help?
The GHG Protocol helps companies prepare a GHG inventory that provides an accurate and fair account of their total emissions, including: 
* Direct emissions, such as those generated by manufacturing companies from their production processes.
* Indirect emissions from energy generated from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or steam.
* Indirect emissions from activities such as the emissions embedded in purchased material inputs, the daily commute of employees, final product transportation and distribution activities, or the consumption of their goods and services.

##### How can business use it?
Businesses can use this information to build an effective strategy for managing and reducing GHG emissions along their full value chain.

Ultimately, it’s up to businesses to align climate actions with their core business strategy to maximize impact while delivering on their business objectives.

#### Carbon pricing 
* Carbon taxes or emissions allowance
* Internal carbon pricing - stimulating innovative ideas on the best ways to allocate capital for delivering higher returns in a low-carbon economy; a source of funds for developing cleaner alternatives and reducing emissions; steering away from carbon emissions and generating funds to finance additional sustainability initiatives.

#### Other ways to decarbonize
* **Target setting**. A target-based approach helps garner the leadership attention and funding approvals required to achieve net zero. It pushes companies to identify new ways to reduce carbon emissions in their value chain and encourage innovation.
* **Accountability**. Companies can also supplement their GHG reduction targets using a governance structure with a well-defined accountability matrix established across leadership and management levels. A well-known technology brand, for example, evaluates its leadership on the annual objectives linked to its sustainability vision, with implications on total compensation.
* **Procurement policies**. Adopting green procurement policies while contracting with new vendors is another way for companies to reduce their GHG emissions. The benefits of green procurement policies cascade across tiers to suppliers and vendors who must reduce their GHG emissions to contract with a company. 
* **Product and business model innovation**. Companies are also looking for opportunities to transform their business models for sustainability. Businesses may implement responsible value chains, characterized as being trusted, net-zero, and circular end-to-end product or process life cycles. 

#### Carbon offsets 
##### Why offsets?
Even after implementing all feasible options to reduce emissions, companies are left with some residual emissions. You can think of these emissions as the gap—or the carbon gap—between the targeted GHG reductions and the actual reductions. Filling the carbon gap by getting rid of residual emissions is necessary for companies to achieve net zero. And they can plug that gap through offsetting. 

##### How does this work?
Using a currency known as carbon credit—where one carbon credit equals one metric ton of GHG emissions avoided or sucked out from the atmosphere—companies can buy carbon offsets by funding projects that reduce or remove GHG emissions to compensate for or neutralize emissions generated from their business activity. This ensures net atmospheric GHG emissions do not increase at the global level. 

#### Decarbonization: A scientific priority 
Companies now have a variety of options available to them in order to achieve their net-zero carbon strategy. The specific option that a company chooses will depend on their industry. Some companies will be able to fully decarbonize, while others may have residual emissions that can be offset through various carbon-offsetting projects. 

Actual reductions through decarbonization will remain a scientific priority, and there are many options to incentivize and drive decarbonization progress such as carbon pricing, science-based target setting, green procurement policies, and product and business model innovation.

### Climate and Carbon: Technology and Transformation Agenda
Business leaders are handling the risks of advancing technology, like cybersecurity, while also pursuing the new opportunities it brings, such as:
* Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the visibility of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance.
* Harnessing the power of analytics, data, and machine learning to optimize energy and water use end-to-end across operations.
* Designing more sustainable products that the market is asking for.
* Using energy storage technologies, such as utility-scale batteries and behind-the-meter batteries, to facilitate a seamless switch from the use of fossil fuels to electricity from renewable sources.
* Switching to green steel manufacturing by replacing the use of fossil fuels with hydrogen produced from renewable electricity

#### Technological breakthroughs in addressing climate change
* **Cloud** - migrating busnesses to cloud.
* **Machine learning** - to predict the optimal balance of operational levers -> reduce energy costs -> reduce its annual emissions.
* **Renewable energy sources** - it can cut energy costs and reduce its carbon footprint compared to traditional sources.
* **Technology platforms** - 360-degree view of operation to prevent food waste.
* **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**.

### Triple Bottom Line
* People
* Planet
* Profit

### Why should a company use a triple bottom line?
1. **Consumer choice**: As markets are globalized, consumers have more choices, and there's never been a greater awareness of ethical corporate behavior. Consumers reward the good companies and punish the bad ones.
2. **Better for business**: It's good business, even by the traditional definition. Success depends on attracting and motivating good people to do their best. Working for an honorable company gives employees pride and enthusiasm.
3. **Superior management**: It's a signal of a thoughtful, long-term perspective, one that measures success and failure in a wider scope and with broader meaning.

### Two problems to solve to adopt triple-bottom-line reporting
1. Acquiring the data. This means developing, down to the furthest reaches of the business activity, an appropriate set of metrics as well as reliable information gathering.
2. Figuring out how to use this data to calculate these bottom lines.

### Ways to assign a value to things that are intangible
1. To assign a dollar value to everything, whether it's planet, people, or profit, or create an index that weighs the three bottom lines in a single cumulative scale.
2. To use several metrics and not combine them. These might be anything from electricity consumption or land use to life expectancy, health, and literacy at the work community.

### Sustainable Performance
#### Describe sustainable performance measurement
Prior to implementing sustainable performance measures in your workplace, it is essential to understand what can be gained from introducing sustainable initiatives and what needs to be measured. This introduction is essential to understanding how sustainable performance measurement can increase the revenue, decrease the expenses, increase employee satisfaction and productivity, and strengthen the brand image of your business.

**Sustainable performance** refers to the output of any system incorporating a process or state that can be maintained at a certain level over the long term. 

Effectively managing sustainable performance requires that you incorporate metrics directly into the implementation of the sustainable initiative so that, as much as possible, up-to-date performance data is available in real time. This performance data can then be benchmarked against previous data or future goals to gauge progress.

This general approach categorizes metrics based on the outcome produced by sustainable initiatives, depending upon which business process they are designed to influence. 

Implementing sustainable business initiatives means altering current processes or creating new ones with the aim of increasing the efficiency, productivity, or capability of a system such that it either reduces unprofitable waste or requires fewer resources (time, money, people) to produce a similar output.

#### Some common misconceptions of sustainability
* Sustainability just means helping the environment.
* Implementing sustainable initiatives is too expensive.
* It doesn’t matter to our customers. 
* There’s no money to be made from sustainability.

Increasing sustainability means using resources more efficiently, which in turn reduces costs or provides new opportunities for revenue. Measuring the progress of these initiatives allows stakeholders to monitor the effect on the bottom line and beyond.

Understanding the "what" and "why" of sustainable performance management is an important step toward implementing measurable sustainable initiatives in your business. An understanding of the positive and negative perceptions attached to the concept of sustainability is also essential to successfully implementing sustainable initiatives and measuring their performance.
 
#### The positive impact of sustainable initiatives
* Optimizing the efficiency of inputs in supply chain.
* An increase in customer loyalty.
* Strengthening of brand image.
* Quantitative benefits that include an increase in sales and stock price, the ability to charge a price premium over the competition, as well as the potential for attracting and retaining highly qualified employees.
* An increase in employee satisfaction and engagement as a result of implementing a sustainable initiative.

#### Measure aspects of your business' sustainability
Successfully implementing sustainable initiatives and measuring their performance is crucial for identifying areas in your business that can benefit.

Understanding the tangible and intangible benefits of increased sustainability in business is the first step.

Avoiding negative consequences is often just as beneficial as achieving positive results.

##### Three categories of metrics to measure sustainability initiatives
* Financial
* Operational
* Strategic

###### Financial metrics
* **Internal** - performance relative to the efficiency with which it uses its assets.
* **External** - overall well-being as seen by external sources. These metrics can be used to compare different companies and can also be used to help predict future performance. External financial metrics can show how sustainable initiatives may improve shareholder returns.

Financial metrics cannot be used to show that a specific initiative had a given impact.

###### Operational metrics
Operational metrics demonstrate the bottom-line effect of a particular sustainable initiative.   

Operational sustainable initiatives often have a clear market value, and as such operational metrics are the most translatable into financial outcomes.

###### Strategic metrics
Strategic metrics are often the hardest to accurately implement because the sustainable initiatives that they seek to measure are usually somewhat intangible.

They usually involve factors such as company reputation, company culture, employee engagement, and brand-related associations from all stakeholders.

The value gained from strategic sustainable initiatives can have a greater impact on the bottom line than financial or operational sustainable initiatives.

Understanding financial, operational, and strategic impacts, as well as how they are all interconnected, gives you a platform from which to analyze your company’s current initiatives and how they can be made more sustainable for the benefit of the bottom line, shareholders, and also for staff and stakeholders.

##### Common financial metrics
* Net Present Value (NPV) = cash inflows - cash outflows
* Net Working Capital = current assets - current liabilities
* Return on Assets (ROA) = net income / total assets
* Return on Investment (ROI) = ( gain from investment - cost of investment ) / cost of investment 
* Share price

##### Common operational metrics
* Energy input costs
* Water usage
* Waste disposal fees
* Revenue from sale of byproducts

##### Common strategic metrics
* Employee satisfaction and retention
* Community support
* Perceived investment risk
* Perceived product quality
* Perceptions of stakeholders
* Brand loyalty
* Bramd association

#### Propose sustainable initiatives
When proposing a sustainable initiative, it is important to frame it in terms of the overall company-related expected benefits. Asking the following questions can help create the right frame of mind: 
* Will the result be lower operating costs through decreased energy or resource use or increased revenue from the sale of a waste byproduct?
* Will the sustainable initiative help mitigate the rising cost of a primary resource needed for production? 
* Will employee engagement, loyalty, and satisfaction be improved by undertaking the proposed sustainable initiative? 
* Will it have a positive effect on the brand image? 

#### Maintain sustainable performance initiatives
Metrics for measuring sustainable performance can showcase the positive effects of sustainable initiatives on revenues, expenses, employee satisfaction, and productivity, as well as the brand image of your business. This information can help to ensure the continued support of sustainable initiatives beyond the short term.

Sustainable business initiatives need not be stigmatized as something done to appease environmentalists and should not be implemented if the financial logic is unsound. By properly measuring the data, a solid business case can be made, and win-win sustainable solutions can be implemented. 

### Knowledge Check
* A **feedback loop** speeds up or slows down a warming trend in climate change. A positive feedback loop accelerates a temperature rise, while a negative feedback loop slows it down. The albedo effect, or ice-albedo feedback, is just one example of a positive loop feedback system. The climate crisis is the current threat to the planet from global warming and its consequences.
* **Evaluating the sustainability of business initiatives requires measurement guidelines that consider external impact**. Establishing appropriate guidelines that measure the tangible effect on external sources provides a foundation for accurately measuring sustainable performance.
* **Industrial Revolution**. With the Industrial Revolution, there was a rapid increase in the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. This sparked a massive increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which caused the Earth’s atmosphere to warm up unnaturally, driving an increase in the global average temperature. Global warming, ocean acidification, permafrost thawing, and ecosystem extinction are some of the several consequences of climate change.
* **Measuring the progress of sustainable initiatives that focus on using resources more efficiently to reduce costs or provide new revenue opportunities allows stakeholders to monitor the effect on the bottom line and beyond**. Accurately monitoring the effect of sustainable initiatives on the bottom line provides stakeholders with the relevant and timely information they need to make informed decisions.
* **2°C**. The Paris Agreement includes a science-based temperature goal to limit global warming to no more than 2°C above preindustrial levels. Under existing policies to limit climate change, projections suggest we will see warming of approximately 3.1°C–3.7°C by 2100. But major scientific studies compiled by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommend limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100.

### Summary
* Climate change is one of the biggest challenges we face as humanity, and an opportunity for business to bring innovation for meaningful change.
* Businesses can play a fundamental role in mitigating climate change and transitioning to a more sustainable future by disrupting the carbon cycle.
* Sustainable performance refers to the output of any system incorporating a process or state that can be maintained at a certain level over the long term.
* Technological breakthroughs are critical for addressing climate change and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
* The triple bottom line helps organizations successfully gauge social and environmental performance.

## Circular Economy
### Pre-assessment
* **Growth need not imply depletion of natural resources**. The circular economy operates on the construct that growth need not imply depletion of natural resources. Products and materials are kept within productive use for as long as possible, and when they reach the end of use, they are looped back into the system. The path to true circularity involves transforming full value chains to create a system in which waste is designed entirely, focusing on adding rather than extracting resources.
* **To evolve to a value chain where waste is designed out completely**. The ultimate aspiration of a circular business model is to evolve into a value chain where waste is designed out completely. The objective is to achieve net positivity, reinforcing rather than depleting resources by adopting restorative models.
* **Information and communication technology (ICT)**. The ICT industry can embrace circularity by refurbishing and reusing existing devices. It can also recover valuable materials from ICT devices at the end of use.
* **Premiumization of circular products**. An example of value creation through new sources of revenue is the premiumization of circular products, enabling products to be sold at a higher price point than their non-circular equivalents. 
* **Reducing environmental impact and fostering societal progress**. The circular economy can help protect the environment and address societal challenges while enabling organizations to achieve competitive advantage.

### Introduction to Circular Economy
#### Linear economy
* Producers make products
* Consumers use products
* At the end of their useful life, dispose of the products

#### Circular economy
* Make
* Use
* Recycle

##### Achieving restorative and regenerative cycle by:
* Refurbishing the old machine for resale
* Remanufacturing the machine for resale with a full warranty
* Repurposing machine components in new products
* Recycling damaged components

##### Benefits of the circular economy's make-use-remake model
* Extending the useful life of a product and its materials, parts, and components
* Extracting maximum value from a product's materials, parts, and components
* Converting potential waste into resources for new products
* Optimizing natural resource yield and labor productivity
* Maximizing product utilization

When adopting the circular economy approach some organizations may find it beneficial to adopt a "product-as-a-service" model. Rather than purchasing a product the customer leases it or pays a usage fee. 

#### Circular Economy and its Benefits
##### Core trends prompting a shift to the circular economy
* **Population growth**. By 2030, we can expect an increase of 40% in the demand for water, 35% for food, and 50% for energy globally.
* **Environmental degradation**. The demand for fresh air and clean water will intensify due to limited resources.
* **Rising consumption**. The linear economy has helped bring more products to more people at affordable prices. Still, while we continue to be more efficient in extracting the most value from raw materials, these achievements have failed to keep up with continued growth in consumption.
* **Technology**. 4IR presents a broad set of technologies that are triggering a massive transformation across global value chains. These include digital, physical, and biological innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology, and cellular and tissue engineering. 

##### Stakeholder's demand for change
Another key driver for the circular economy is the stakeholder's demand for change.

###### Stakeholder groups
* **Consumers** are increasingly concerned about the sustainability of their purchases and have shown a preference for circular products.
* **Customers**. Industries that are less visible to end consumers are already experiencing pressure from their business-to-business customers for more sustainable practices and for better-designed products that can be reused or recycled. 
* **Regulators and policymakers**. Governments are recognizing the potential that the circular economy offers. For example, the European Union (EU) Circular Economy Action establishes the EU’s vision to shift to circular. This includes the goal of extracting the greatest value from all material streams, thus reducing GHG emissions and creating new economic opportunities.

##### Role of investors and businesses in the shift to the circular economy
* **Investors**. - Investors are interested in sustainable and circular business models because they can align with greater long-term return.
* **Businesses**. - Business is seeing the opportunities of a circular economy. The financial imperative to act is compelling.

##### Utilizing the circular advantage
###### Significance of the circular economy for our clients
Adopting circular economy principles helps clients attain higher resource efficiency, generate less waste, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

##### Essential factors to consider when shifting to a circular economy
* Consumer readiness
* Technology and infrastructure
* Materials/waste considerations
* Product attributes

The opportunities typically fall into three categories, which are the changes companies make to: 
* The product and service itself
* Production processes and the extended supply chain
* New circular business models

#### Generating value through the circular economy model
* **Cost reduction**. Reducing input costs and operating costs, increasing effectiveness of resources. It does not require changes in culture or consumer behavior, although it may require significant investment in technology and processes.
* **New sources of revenue**. Repremiumizing circular products.
* **Value shifts**. Shifts from one products andservices to anothe ones. This means a shift in the existing value instead of adding new value to the industry supply chain.

#### Circularity potential in various industries
##### Industry 1: Metals and mining
Until recently, circular innovation in the metals and mining industry was focused on operational improvements. Now, the industry is starting to think about "circular" more holistically.

##### Industry 2: Information and communications technology (ICT) 
The downside is that the pace of innovation has ensured that the marketplace is flooded with ICT devices with short product life cycles, as consumers opt for frequent upgrades to the latest features. 

##### Industry 3: Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)
This industry comprises a wide variety of goods, including personal care products, food and beverages, cleaning and laundry products, plastic goods, and less expensive consumer electronics. While significant progress has been made in several areas including reduced water and waste usage, resource consumption in this industry continues to be high, with significant waste streams throughout the value chain. 

### Circular Economy: Key Frameworks and Enablers
#### Types of waste
* **Limited or scarce resources** are energy and materials that cannot be continually regenerated over time, such as minerals and rare earth elements, water, non-recyclable material, and fossil energy.
* **Unutilized capacity** refers to assets and products that are not wholly used throughout their useful life. Stepping up practices around sharing, co-owning, co-using, resource pooling, and so on is the path to circular value.
* **Underutilized life cycles** occur when products are prematurely disposed of, even though significant useful life remains.
* **Impact of usage** includes emissions, energy, or undesirable waste products created in the delivery and use of the product. 

#### Five circular business models
* **Sharing Platforms**. Use of sharing platforms lets different but interdependent individuals or organizations interact more, and brings together supply and demand to better use products and assets.
* Use of fully **Renewable, Recyclable, Circular Iinputs** involves creating products for which consumers are willing to pay more.
* **Product-as-a-service** is about offering a combination of products and services that seek to provide the customer their functionality instead of the product itself.
* ** Product Use Extension** prolongs product use through repair, reprocessing, upgrading, and resale, resulting in fewer purchases over time.
* A **New Product Substitute** is the introduction of a completely new product to take the place of a less sustainable one. A new product could be a safer, less polluting alternative such as use of organic fertilizers for synthetic fertilizers or plant-based meat for traditional meat.

Out of the five circular business models, three (use of renewable inputs, product use extension, and new product substitute) target production, while the other two (product-as-a-service and sharing platforms) reshape the interaction between the consumer and the product, thus covering the end-to-end circular value chain. 

##### Circular business models: Case studies 
###### Renewable, recyclable, circular inputs
Use of fully renewable, recyclable, circular inputs focuses on both the materials going directly into the product, such as raw materials or subcomponents, as well as other necessary inputs such as energy. A comprehensive shift to more circular inputs requires firms to reconsider design, sourcing, and manufacturing stages.

Footwear and apparel manufacturers are using materials previously designated as waste, such as recycled shoes, plastic bottles, and scrap from the manufacturing process, to develop new products. The results of adopting more circular inputs are impressive. Almost all of the production waste is being diverted from landfills, and thousands of tons of plastic have been saved from ending up in the oceans. In fact, a large percentage of new products are now made predominantly from recycled material.

###### Product use extension
In this model, products are designed for longevity. When a consumer no longer wants to use a product, it does not mean the end of its life cycle; that product is not disposed of, or even recycled, but rather kept in use by selling in an alternative market as is or refurbishing or repairing the product before reselling it.

A large energy management company has found a novel way to enjoy added financial advantage. Essential components installed at the customer site are upgraded rather than replaced. By extending the utility of its equipment, the company can save nearly two-thirds of the cost of new installations. Additionally, the materials recovered from the customer site when component upgrades take place can be reused, recycled, repaired, or refurbished to maximize the value extracted from these components and minimize waste. 

###### Product-as-a-service
This product-as-a-service model makes it possible to maximize a product’s use and value, addressing wasted capacity and wasted life cycles. In other words, product-as-a-service reduces the need for individual product ownership. In this model, companies own a product and monetize the use of that product by charging customers per use or perhaps through a subscription. 

Multiple fashion brands and online retailers have adopted a product-as-a-service model for customers to rent high-end fashion apparel or handbags for a fraction of the cost of purchasing and owning the item. They also offer subscription services that allow customers to revamp their wardrobe by paying a monthly fee.

###### Sharing platforms
Examples of the sharing platforms business model include firms that rent construction equipment at competitive prices. Through this platform, customers can rent various types of equipment that are available over a wide geographic region.

###### New product substitute
The new product substitute model aims to improve a product’s functionality while reducing the adverse environmental impact from its use. It can also reduce additional handling and disposal costs. 

A number of vegan food companies have introduced meat alternatives by using plant-based products to reduce the environmental impact of the meat industry.

For instance, compared to the traditional meat-based burgers, the plant-based alternatives require almost no water and less than half the energy. As a result, these companies contribute to a tremendous reduction in carbon emissions.

##### Five enablers of the circular economy
* **Disruptive Technologies** focused on accelerating the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). These 4IR technologies can be classified into three key groups. The first is digital technologies, based largely on advancements in computer science and electronics. The second is physical technologies, based on the fundamental properties of materials and energy. The third is biological technologies, based on the biological aspects of living organisms, or materials based on living organisms, that are used in products and processes.
* **Design**. Here, the key is to have a clear strategy at the design stage to incorporate longer use cycles and end-of-use recovery for products. A number of product designs disregard end-of-use scenarios, which can be a deterrent to achieving circularity. For example, many products have parts that cannot be easily reused or recycled—their material quality or construction prevents materials from being easily separated.
* **Consumer Engagement**. This is an opportunity to reshape what it means to meet customer demand in new ways and to drive new behaviors. Often, customers are interested in the experience, or the service offered, rather than the product. This shift in mindset opens the door to engaging with consumers in new ways. Business models that focus on providing a service or experience rather than product ownership, such as product-as-a-service and sharing platforms, pave the way for a shift from ownership to access.
* **Reverse Logistics and Ecosystems**. Reverse logistics involves collecting and aggregating products and materials. Reverse logistics also includes value-adding activities that are essential to circular business models, such as sorting, separating, and reprocessing recovered products and materials. There are several challenges related to operating reverse logistics ecosystems. These include high warehouse operation costs as well as unreliable quality and quantity of the supply of recovered materials. 
* **Government Policies or Regulations**. Policies can support business model innovation by setting up reverse logistics. They can support technical innovation by influencing product design or production process standards. And they can boost social innovation by initiating new collaboration and social initiatives to enhance cooperation in the value chain. For example, several governments and regulatory authorities across the globe have introduced directives for manufacturers of energy-related products to build energy efficiency in product design as a way of ensuring sustainable consumption.

### Circular Economy: Accelerating the Circular Agenda with Technology
#### Industrial disruption through technological innovation
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) plays a significant role in helping businesses transition from a linear to a circular economy.

Each development has unleashed technological innovations that enabled remarkable advances in business performance. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) continues in this tradition but takes it even further with a host of technologies disrupting possibly every industry worldwide. 

#### The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)
The 4IR includes a wide plethora of technologies and combinations of them that are breaking new ground across global value chains.

#### Technologies powering the 4IR 
* **Digital technologies** rely on computer science and electronics. They work by connecting physical resources with technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), and by processing and finding insights in the large and growing volume of information of connected physical resources. Some examples are Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and big data analytics.
* **Physical technologies** are based on the fundamental properties of materials and energy. Some examples include robotics, 3D printing, energy harvesting (capturing, storing, and supplying energy that would otherwise dissipate by using specialized equipment or materials), and carbon capture and storage.
* **Biological technologies** are based on the biological aspects of living organisms, or materials based on living organisms, that are used in products and processes. Some examples include bioenergy, bio-based materials, genetic engineering, and hydroponics and aeroponics.

#### Adoption of 4IR technologies 
##### Advantages of adoption of 4IR technologies
* Reducing dependence on resource-intensive products
* Providing higher information transparency
* Increasing efficiency in production and distribution
* Improving customer-centricity

Currently, the adoption of digital technology far outpaces that of biological and physical technologies.

Digital technologies are more widely used than physical and biological technologies due to the capital and longer research timelines needed for the latter.

#### Combination of 4IR technologies to accelerate circular businesses 
The 4IR technologies can create value through application at any stage of the value chain, and this can vary depending on industry, customer market, and the specific challenges the sector may face. But what is true across the board is the key to competitive advantage. 

#### Company examples of 4IR technologies
* **Hotels and catering companies** with large kitchens are now using AI to improve the sustainability and profitability of their kitchens by reducing food waste. These companies use a cloud-enabled food waste system that allows users to record and analyze what is being thrown into the bin. By capturing information from photos and videos, the system collects a massive library of images depicting food waste. These images are then used to train and enhance a predictive model. 
* **Indoor farming**. One interesting example is the adoption of aeroponics and predictive analytics by indoor farming companies. These companies are pioneers in an agriculture industry that faces the daunting circular challenge of producing significantly more food by 2050 to feed a growing population. The company’s vertical farming infrastructure captures and reuses water in closed-loop systems. Their aim is to reduce and even eliminate waste and achieve targeted agricultural output while also increasing quality.
* **Waste management**. Combining the power of digital and physical technologies, the company’s robotics uses machine vision and advanced AI to power its robot. Specifically, the company’s AI identifies materials in the unhygienic, cluttered conditions existing in most facilities. The robot can then separate the commodities with almost no impact on existing operations. The company also digitizes the material stream, storing information in the cloud, which can then be analyzed to optimize operations.
* **Fashion**. Companies in the fashion industry are also deploying technologies to deliver sustainability and efficiency. A textile startup manufactures textiles from food crop harvest leftovers. Another one uses algae as a dye.

#### Transformative technologies opening up new opportunities in the circular economy
* **Blockchain**. It uses unique identifiers to ensure a product’s authenticity. This technology can provide a unique, traceable digital identity for a product that can be stored on a blockchain. This makes it easier to track assets through the value chain, guarantee their authenticity, and enhance value recovery at the end of the asset’s useful life.
* **Smart digital twin and AR/VR**. In this approach, physical assets, people, processes, systems, places, and devices are replicated and maintained in a digital environment. This allows for data analysis and system monitoring to conduct predictive maintenance or to develop new solutions.

#### Determining the right mix of technologies
Clearly, 4IR innovations have created tremendous opportunities for companies. To fully leverage the potential of these technologies and gain competitive advantage, firms must deploy the five circular business models across organization-wide functional areas. The key is to determine the right mix that can be woven comprehensively into an organization's ways of working, to **empower change** and **create optimal circular value**.

### Knowledge Check
* **Population growth, environmental degradation, climate change, rising consumption, and technological advancement**. The shift from the linear to the circular economy is driven by three key demographic trends: population growth, environmental degradation and climate change, and rising consumption. Cutting across these three trends is the core macro trend of unprecedented technological advancement.
* **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)**. Tires are an example of products subjected to EPR in many countries. The EPR system focuses on the end-of-use treatment of products. Its primary aim is to increase the degree of product recovery and minimize the impact of waste on the environment.
* **Design**. Using recycled plastic as a component in mobile phone manufacture is an example of the circular enabler design. The key aspect of this enabler is to have a clear strategy at the design stage to incorporate longer use cycles and end-of-use recovery for products.
* **Physical**. 3D printing is an example of physical technology. Physical technologies are based on the basic properties of materials, energy, forces of nature, and their interactions. Other examples of physical technology are robotics and energy harvesting.
* **Blockchain**. The pharmaceutical company requires strong supply chain traceability. Using blockchain technology to track and trace products can be beneficial, especially for regulated pharmaceutical industries. The traceable digital identity of the physical goods can be stored on a blockchain, which makes it easier to track assets and enhance value recovery at the end of use.

### Summary
* In a linear economy, products are made, used, and disposed of at the end of their useful life.
* The circular economy opens up a new path forward by shifting from conventional “linear” business operations to new business models based on circularity.
