# Sustainability Part 2
## Sustainable Customer Brand, Growth, and Experience

### Pre-assessment
* **Financial, operational, and strategic**. Sustainability initiatives are generally measured by using metrics in one of three categories: Financial, operational, and strategic
* **Identifying connections between customer experiences and value chains**. Sustainable customer experiences can positively influence the pursuit of sustainability ambitions. To understand where such experiences can have the greatest influence on relevant SDGs, the first step for companies is to identify connection points between customer experiences and their value chains. 
* **Reinforcing the continued positive effects of current initiatives**. Maintaining a corporate culture that supports sustainable initiatives often requires reinforcing the continued positive effects of current initiatives, and this requires maintaining reliable data. 
* **Laying the proper groundwork**. Businesses can successfully implement sustainable initiatives when they first take the time to lay the proper groundwork.
* **CSR strategies and models**. Understanding the need for CSR, the strategies and models of CSR, and the macro global trend, will help you leverage this knowledge to develop CSR strategies within your functions that are linked to business success.

### Introduction to Sustainable Customer Brand, Growth, and Experience
#### Three pillars of sustainability
* Economic
* Social
* Environmental 

There are 17 goals set out in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030; ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns is one of them.

##### These goals aim to tackle issues related to
* Environmental degradation
* Climate change
* Peace and justice
* Inequality
* Poverty

##### Gap between intentions and actions.
To close this gap, sustainability needs to be offered as part of a product or service that meets people's needs, and it must answer these four questions:
1. **Ability**: Do I have what I need (time, access, understanding) to make a more sustainable decision?
2. **Impact**: Does my decision actually have a positive impact?
3. **Priorities**: Does this sustainable decision ask me to trade off against something that is more important to me?
4. **Identity**: Is this sustainable decision compatible with my values, lifestyle, who I am, and how I want to be seen?

### Dynamics of Sustainable Customer Brand, Growth, and Experience
#### Exploring the most effective approaches
* **System change**. System thinking is an approach that proposes that we address a problem by examining it in its entirety rather than focusing on just one area. 
* **Language**. A consistent way of talking about sustainability is a first step. Some people see sustainability as only environmental while others understand the societal impacts.
* **Circular design tools**. In the circular economy, our existing “take-make-waste” approach shifts to circularity principles of “take, make, take, make,” where waste is designed out entirely and materials are retained in productive use for the maximum time possible through reuse or recycling, or both.
* **Values**. Designing new products and experiences with only a sustainability lens is not enough. Humans have a variety of needs and sustainability is just one. Other values come into play in purchasing behavior, such as cultural context, beliefs, or aspirations. Understanding customers is most effective when it is holistic, embracing the entirety of their experience.
* **Future proofing**. Sustainable customer experiences look at tomorrow, not just today. By imagining distant future scenarios, we can anticipate some unintended consequences of the products and services we are designing. Think of ridesharing platforms that can reduce carbon emissions but also have societal impacts in terms of competition and regulation.

#### Exploring new business models
##### Circular business models
Circular business models can effectively tackle waste. These models involve sharing a product's use, access, or ownership on sharing platforms like ridesharing. In product-as-a-service situations, customers can enjoy the use of a product while the producer retains ownership.

##### Ecosystem and partnerships
An ecosystem approach involves forming partnerships across industries, sectors, and with policymakers and societal stakeholders. This approach is effective in addressing system-wide challenges. Collaboration is key to achieving a successful transformation.

Innovative business models and partnerships that prioritize societal and environmental challenges can create mutual benefits for all parties involved. By providing valuable products or services while also addressing pressing issues, brands can set themselves apart, drive growth, and inspire innovation on a larger scale.

#### Communicating with authenticity
Honest, transparent, and ethical communications resonate best with people. When a brand conveys authenticity, it avoids moral superiority and demonstrates empathy. 

Focusing on the two or three most important aspects of a sustainable experience is better.

Communications and branding strategies, such as traffic light eco-labels or sustainability information on product packaging, can help inform, educate, and positively influence customers' decisions regarding products and services.

#### Sustainability-native innovators 
There are a growing number of innovators who prioritize sustainability and set higher standards for customer expectations in different industries. The term "sustainability-native" refers to start-ups that prioritize sustainability in their business model and mission from inception, much like digital-native companies transformed the digital landscape.

#### Making sustainable customer experiences a priority
Brands are a powerful tool for helping people make the best choices for themselves and the planet, and that's good for both business and society. Articulating a strong brand purpose can accelerate an organization's swift move into new areas of growth and opportunity and ultimately catapult action toward sustainability targets and goals.

### Societal Importance of Sustainability
#### Sustainability and our consumption habits 
Sustainability is often defined as meeting the needs of current generations without negatively impacting the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Today, we face a challenge in ensuring that future generations live in a world that can meet their needs. As we confront climate change, diminishing natural resources, increased waste and pollution, and other issues, current consumption habits and behaviors are major contributors to these problems. 

#### Environmental challenges driven by consumerism 
##### Consumerism and capitalism
Recognizing that humans have needs that must be met is the first step in changing unsustainable customer behaviors. The next step is to design products and services that can sustainably meet those needs, while also supporting customers in adopting new behaviors.

##### Barriers to sustainable behaviors
* **Affordability**. The sustainable option is the more expensive one, with companies often charging a premium for sustainable packaging, ingredients, and even brands.
* **Skepticism**. After the recent explosion of sustainability and environmental product claims and marketing campaigns, people are increasingly skeptical of sustainability motivations and outcomes.
* **A lack of guidance**. Studies show that people want to live more sustainably, but for different reasons, are not always able to. A whopping 96% think their actions such as donating, recycling, or ethical buying can make a difference. But they crave guidance. In fact, 88% say they want the brands they use to help them be more environmentally friendly and ethical.
* **The Say-Do gap**. People often have good intentions but don’t always act on them. Studies show at least 50% want to make more sustainable lifestyle choices, but only about 25% are reported to actually make those choices.

##### Full range of impacts in consumption
It is crucial for a company to identify and manage both its positive and negative impacts, while remaining honest and transparent with its stakeholders.

##### Achieving sustainability
Shifting towards sustainable customer experiences is vital for meeting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the road map using which future generations can take care of their own needs. For these goals to be met, the social and environmental aspects of sustainability must be in focus.

### Significance of Sustainable Customer Brand and Growth for Clients and Ecosystems
#### Stakeholder pressure on businesses
Investors, customers, employees, and governments alike are pressuring business to demonstrate sustainability leadership.

#### Sustainability laws 
Many countries around the world are enacting laws and new forms of taxation around Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues to spur companies to act more sustainably. 

#### Challenges to the adoption of sustainable practices
* Reluctance to develop simplistic products and solutions
* Short-term thinking
* Fear of changing status quo
* Not knowing where to start

#### Sustainable value waiting to be unlocked
Sustainability generates value, either directly or indirectly. This value falls into three main areas: 
* Customer experience
* Business value 
* Employee retention and attraction 

##### Customer experience
Trust, transparency, and sense of agency in the customer experience are key to encouraging more people to engage in sustainability and sustainable purchases. 

By focusing on desirability, ease of use, and incentives, it’s possible to change behavior and make sustainability an obvious choice. 

It’s also important to ensure the customer is an integral part of the sustainable experience.

##### Business value
There is growing evidence that sustainable customer experiences prove the return on investment and help drive enduring business value.   
* **Customer engagement**. More customers are engaged, spurring greater sales and revenue. There are two sources of value: attracting new customers and gaining increased loyalty in frequency and amount of spend from existing customers.
* **Reduced risk**. Risk is reduced. Lapses in environmental, social, or ethical conduct can result in significant fines for companies. This can also impact business reputation.
* **Improved cost efficiences**. Cost efficiencies are improved. Reducing consumption of water, energy, and raw materials delivers cost savings.

#### Employee retention and attractiveness
* **Mission**. Based on a US poll, companies where 80% of employees believe in the mission or purpose of their organization have a 41% reduction in absenteeism and a 33% increase in quality compared to companies where only 40% of their employees believe in their organization’s mission or purpose.
* **Productivity** in firms with established environmental standards has increased to 16% as compared to firms that failed to adopt sustainability practices. In time, companies with higher corporate responsibility performance can see a 25-50% reduction in their average employee turnover. The annual employee quit rates can also be reduced in such companies by 3-3.5%. This can save talent replacement costs by as much as 90-200% of an employee’s annual salary for each retained position.

#### Delivering sustainability objectives 
By focusing on the needs of customers, employees, and society as a whole, businesses have the opportunity to design sustainable customer experiences that benefit customers and companies alike. Working with its business partners and clients in an ecosystem approach, a company can deliver to an even greater degree on its sustainability objectives, making sustainability a win-win growth opportunity for everyone.

### Technology and Transformation Agenda for Sustainable Brand, Growth, and Experience
#### Sustainable Customer Experiences
Sustainable customer experiences are about people and brands, how to deliver and consume products and services in a way that meets customers' needs while also being socially and environmentally sustainable.

When managed effectively, technologies can enhance the sustainable customer experience, brand, and growth in various ways, which can help create better products and services for both people and the planet.

#### Emerging technologies
By utilizing intelligent and thoughtful strategies, all technologies have the ability to craft enduring customer experiences that prioritize the well-being of both society and the environment.

##### Augmented reality
More and more businesses are using Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Using AR, visual, auditory, or other sensory information can be superimposed onto the physical world to enhance a specific experience and offer a wider pool of users greater accessibility to services.

A great advantage of AR and Virtual Reality (VR) is that they help avoid the physical movement of both products and people and reduce the environmental impact linked to transportation and possible product returns.

#####  Digital twins
Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical devices or assets, such as buildings, created using real-world data on usage, materials, external conditions, and maintenance.  

Digital twins can help companies create products and services that are more circular and customer centric.

##### Artificial intelligence and machine learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are widely used today and can also play a key role in sustainable customer experiences. In AI and ML, human intelligence is simulated in machines programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions in scenarios such as learning and problem-solving.

AI can provide valuable insights into sustainable product and service attributes that matter to customers for better customer experiences.

##### Blockchain
Blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions, can enhance trust and transparency in sustainable customer experiences. For example, blockchain makes end-to-end traceability possible by serving as the trusted ledger through which assets like currencies, contracts, and data can be exchanged.

Blockchain solutions are being offered in the food industry to ensure traceability throughout the supply chain.

#### Transformation agenda
A sustainable brand, growth, and customer experience rely on a cultural transformation of both customers and businesses. 

Design can also play a crucial role in this transformation. A Venn diagram displays the three facets of transformation that must be considered. Sustainability can't be achieved without environmental, economic, and social transformation. These facets are interrelated and contribute towards the overall goal of sustainability.

##### The three facets of transformation
* **Sustainability at the center**. When sustainability is at the core of corporate strategy, it is much better positioned to create value. Viewed as a strategic asset rather than a cost, sustainability can drive innovation and build a competitive edge. Depending on its starting point, every company will define its journey to sustainability differently, in line with its maturity, culture, and purpose. 
* **Holistic approach**. For long-term sustainability, the value created needs to be measured against the three sustainability pillars: People, Profit, and Planet. We must create trans-disciplinary teams and work with a systemic approach to ensure a holistic view. 
* **Iterations for desirability**. Crafting sustainable experiences that customers appreciate is crucial to ensure business relevance. Design plays a significant role in creating desirable and sustainable experiences, achieved through multiple rounds of exploratory and generative research. Exploratory research helps to discover mindsets and new opportunities, while generative research helps to define, refine, and prioritize ideas and concepts. Prototyping and testing are also crucial in ensuring that the experience is perfect, increasing the chances of customer appreciation.

#### Employee engagement
Employee engagement plays a fundamental role for the transformation agenda to become a reality beyond leadership actions. Understanding the needs of employees in delivering these sustainable customer products and experiences is crucial to reduce the gap between strategy and action.
* Long-term plans
* Tools
* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Cross-functional teams

#### Combining technology and transformation
By combining the best of both the technology and transformation agendas, companies can drive their sustainable customer experiences to the next level.

### Achieving Sustainable Customer Brand, Growth, and Experience Goals in Business
To achieve sustainable customer experiences, businesses need clear ambitions and performance indicators while also reassessing their value chains to align with the applicable United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

#### Leveraging ESG materiality assessment
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help businesses set their sustainability ambitions. An exercise that can help them in this journey is the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) materiality assessment.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outline 17 priorities and aspirations for 2030 that address the world's most urgent social, economic, and environmental challenges. Each goal has detailed sub-targets and measurement indicators that can help businesses align their ambitions with the SDGs.

To determine which goals are most relevant, a business can undergo an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) materiality assessment, an exercise that helps prioritize areas of focus based on what matters most to stakeholders and the long-term financial interests of the organization. These priorities often map to specific SDGs.

The overarching objective is to set impactful yet profitable sustainability ambitions, put in place the processes, tools, and resources to meet these ambitions, and then measure and report on progress against set targets.

#### Sustainable customer experiences: Setting ambitions
Sustainable customer experiences can positively influence the pursuit of sustainability ambitions. To understand where such experiences can significantly influence relevant SDGs, the first step for companies is to identify connection points between customer experiences and their value chains.

Using the SDGs to inform the design of customer experiences encourages companies to find innovative solutions. In doing so, they meet customers’ expectations, stand out from the competition, and contribute to progressing their materiality objectives for investors. In this way, the SDGs are an effective way to consistently track progress on both the environmental and social goals that the company has set.

#### Sustainable customer experiences: Measuring performance
An important first step in measuring performance is prioritizing SDGs and mapping respective value chain impacts.

There are three important questions to ask during this stage:
* Did the choices associated with the customer experience drive progress against the KPIs? 
* Why or why not? 
* How can these choices be revisited, expanded, or both across other parts of the business? 

At this stage, it is also helpful to consider how the customer experience choices have positively or negatively impacted customer perceptions. Do they shape how the customer perceives the product or brand? Have the customer’s intentions changed, indicating a more significant interest in the purchase? Would the customer now be willing to pay more for the product or service? 

Useful indicators might include the percentage of users who engage more deeply with the proposed content, shifts in user profiles, repeat purchases, and referral trends. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures customer satisfaction, is another helpful indicator to consider at this stage.

#### Communicating results 
It is important for companies to regularly communicate their progress to keep customers, employees, partners, and investors engaged. Investors are closely monitoring how companies report their progress towards the SDGs. Therefore, it is logical to create KPIs for sustainable experiences that match a company's ESG reporting and disclosures. This approach will ensure that the company's ESG report documents the progress that has been achieved.

#### Society and environment 
There is great value for companies in linking the SDGs to their ambition for a more sustainable customer experience, as the global goals can act as a North Star, guiding actions that can make a real difference for society. 

And while it's necessary to measure the sustainable customer experience to assess progress, that isn't always an easy task. That's why it's crucial to communicate with customers and to conduct qualitative research to get the human story behind the numbers.

A combination of qualitative and quantitative data is the best way to know if a company's ambition to achieve sustainable customer experiences is having the desired effect.

### Sustainability Metrics and Reporting
Sustainability reporting is a process where organizations measure, disclose, and are held accountable for their social, environmental, and economic performance.

#### Reporting definition by The world business council
sustainability reporting is an attempt to describe the company's contribution towards sustainable development.

#### Reporting definition by The Global Reporting Initiative 
sustainability reporting is the practice of measuring, disclosing, and being accountable to internal and external stakeholders for organizational performance towards the goal of sustainable development.

#### Business benefits from reporting
* The reporting process forces a company to set sustainability goals and articulate a strategy.
* Setting robust metrics and indicators forces companies to improve their internal data gathering and reporting systems.
* Makes it easier for companies to compare both their own performance over time and their performance compared to other companies.
* The reporting process is a great way to communicate with both internal and external stakeholders.
* Public reporting sends a powerful message to employees, consumers, and other interested parties that the company takes sustainability seriously as a core business issue.

#### Reporting context
* Companies now report across the triple bottom line, reporting comprehensively on their social, environmental, and economic impacts.
* Companies are being held accountable for what their suppliers do, they are increasingly reporting on supply chain and value chain impacts.

#### Good reporting
* Sustainability reporting should enable readers to reach informed conclusions and make decisions about the company based on the type and quality of data reported.
* A good report helps both a company and its stakeholders to answer questions:
 * What is our vision for corporate responsibility?
 * What are our most significant impacts?
 * What are our most significant dilemmas?
 * What systems and processes do we have in place to manage these impacts?
 * How did we perform?", "What do we plan to address in the future?
* Reporting should provide readers with a sense of how one company's contribution to sustainable development compares to those of other companies and to society at large. 

##### Principles of good reporting of leading global framework for sustainability reporting from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
* **Materiality**: For example, a petroleum company should report on the environmental and social impacts of its exploration and production rather than on how much electricity it uses in its office buildings.
* **Completeness**: Making sure that the data reflects the full period covered by the report and covers all the major regions a company does business in.
* **Stakeholder inclusiveness**: You know who your stakeholders are, and reports address their reasonable expectations and interests.
* **Sustainability context**: Reports present more than financial results. Reports present company performance in terms of regional, national, and global environmental limits as well as social and economic objectives.
* **Accuracy**: The reporting is sufficiently detailed and transparent to give readers a true sense of company performance.
* **Balance**: Disclosing both the good and the bad and paying the right amount of attention to the most important issues. Honest discussion of failures and challenges not only allows stakeholders to get a clear picture of a company's sustainability performance but also goes a long way toward building trust.
* **Clarity**: Information is simply presented, well organized, and accessible to as many people as possible who would find the report useful. Ideally, the report would also be accessible in multiple languages and technologies.
* **Comparability**: Stakeholders can analyze changes in the organization's performance over time or compare the company's performance relative to other companies. The best way to ensure this is by using standard metrics and key performance indicators.
* **Reliability**: Readers have confidence in the report because it includes some form of external assurance by an auditor, documentation on external assurance, evidence to support complex calculations, or the original source of the information.
* **Timeliness**: Reporting occurs on a regular schedule, often aligned with the financial reporting schedule. This way, information is easily compared, and readers know when to expect the information. Many companies are moving to more frequent and shorter reporting.

#### Types of audience for sustainability performance reporting
* Employees
* Investors
* Customers
* Community
* Government
* NGOs
* Value Chain
* Industry

#### Defining Materiality
Materiality is the concept of determining a company's most significant sustainability impacts. 

Material issues reflect the most significant economic, environmental, and social impacts of a company and should form the cornerstone of a company's sustainability strategy.
* What is the level of stakeholder interest in the issue?
* What is the current and potential business impact of the issue on the company?
* And how much is the company able to influence this issue?

##### Steps involved in identifying material issues:
* **Inventory of Sustainability Issues**: The first step is for the company to compile a comprehensive list of all the sustainability issues that concern its business. This list should cover economic, environmental, and social aspects.
* **Prioritization Criteria**: To assess sustainability concerns, consider stakeholder interest, evaluate current and potential impact, and determine the ability to manage issues through operations, products, and services.
* **Materiality Matrix**: Plot the identified sustainability issues on a matrix. Typically, companies use stakeholder interest and business impact as axes on the matrix. The issues that fall in the upper right-hand corner of the matrix are considered to have both high business impact and high stakeholder interest and are thus deemed material.
* **Focus on Material Issues**: Companies should focus their sustainability reporting and activities on the issues identified as material. These are the topics that are most relevant to stakeholders and have the potential to significantly affect the company's performance and reputation.

##### Some more examples of materiality matrix in use
###### A leading financial service provider
* Accountability and transparency
* Asset protection
* Responsible finacial services
* Local community support

###### A globally leading petroleum producer
* Safety
* Employee development
* Environment and human rights operations
* Climate change
* Community development

###### A multi-mational casual dining retailer

* Employment experience
* Community

###### A globally leading sporting goods manufacturer
* Environental impact of products
* Supplier labor conditions
* Community sports

###### A global pharmaceutical manufacturer
* Access to healthcare
* Business ethics
* Climate change

#### Defining metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
 KPIs are the key performance indicators, a subset of the larger set of metrics, the few measures of a company's critical success factors. For example, net revenue or GHG emissions reduction as a percentage of target. 

KPIs have both internal and external purposes. Internally, the purpose of KPI is to drive desired behaviors and to guide decision-making.

Externally, companies use KPIs to communicate their sustainability performance to others and to enable comparisons to other companies. 

Good KPIs have characteristics that make them useful for both internal management and external communication purposes. A good KPI is SMART. 

KPIs should be comparable and simple.

##### Distinctions between KPIs
* leading and lagging indicators.
* absolute and relative indicators
* quantitative  and qualitative indicators
* inputs, outputs, and outcomes

##### Chosing pronciples for KPIs
* meaningful
* KPIs that have been developed through consultative processes like the Global Reporting Initiative indicators (GRI)
* by outside parties

#### Examples of KPIs used to measure and manage sustainability efforts 
* **Global apparel retailer**. A global apparel retailer identified four material issues (energy, products, workplace, and service) and defined goals and KPIs under each of these pillars. They used absolute indicators like total carbon emissions to emphasize their commitment to reducing their environmental impact regardless of sales and production growth. 
* **Global sportswear retailer**. A global sportswear retailer focuses on material issues related to the environmental impact of materials and manufacturing processes for their products. They have set goals to eliminate waste and toxic substances and use specific metrics to assess product sustainability before market release. They also addressed labor conditions in its supply chain by breaking down the goal into subtopics and establishing indicators to drive desired behaviors.
* **Multinational retail and wholesaling corporation**. A multinational retail and wholesaling corporation has developed a unique KPI to measure the maturity level of its logistics processes across different countries and markets. This indicator, on a scale from 1 to 20, is primarily designed as an internal management tool rather than for external communication or comparison

#### Reporting and assurance
##### Different channels through which companies reach different audiences
* Employees. CR report, Internal magazine, Intranet.
* Investors. Annual report, Briefing, Press release, Questionnare, Road show.
* Customers. Advertising, In-store leaflets, Website, Product labeling.
* Community. Site newsletter, Local press article.
* Government. CR report, Briefing, Regulated disclosure.
* NGOs. CR report, Face-to-face meeting.
* Value Chain. Tender document, Supplier meeting.
* Industry. CR report, Purchasing guidelines.

##### Assurance
Assurance is the name given to formal efforts made by the company to enhance the reader's confidence and report information. This can include a formal auditing or verification process, but it can also take other forms, such as a stakeholder panel, commentary, or expert opinion.

###### Verification ways
* Traditional verification or audit statement conducted by an authorized and established auditing firm.
* Management evaluation.
* Certification statement issued by an independent standard-setting body.
* Expert statement by an individual expert.
* Stakeholder comments made by an NGO or stakeholder group, such as a community advisory panel.

###### Questions when making decisions pertaining to assurance:
1. Think about which stakeholder you are trying to win trust from. Who is your audience for assurance?
2. Ask what information that stakeholder needs to feel more confident. Is it the general accuracy or materiality of reporting or performance data? Is it a specific issue, like labor standards or carbon emissions?
3. Ask who could best build that stakeholder's confidence. Who would your stakeholder trust the most? Auditors? Stakeholders? Experts?

We can think of the reader of the report as a societal investor who uses the report to assess the company's sustainability commitment, performance, and impact and who then makes a decision to work for the company, buy its products, invest in it, or simply allow it to continue to operate and innovate.

### Knowledge Check
* **To update stakeholders about sustainable development contributions**. Sustainability reporting serves to inform a wide range of stakeholders about a company's contributions to sustainable development and its efforts in various areas.
* **Simplicity in products, short-term vision, resistance to change, and a lack of direction**. Four key barriers that often impede the adoption of sustainable practices or products are simplicity in products, short-term vision, resistance to change, and a lack of direction.
* **Identifying and prioritizing significant impacts in economic, environmental, and social aspects**. Materiality, in the context of sustainability reporting, refers to identifying and prioritizing a company's most significant economic, environmental, and social impacts. 
* **Avoiding, competing, accommodating, collaborating, and compromising**. Conflict management involves five strategies and techniques to understand, address, and resolve conflicts in a way that minimizes negative consequences and fosters better relationships: Avoiding, competing, accommodating, collaborating, and compromising.
* **Explaining the product's sustainability goals and intentions**. It's important to clearly communicate why the product or service was designed with sustainability in mind and what the company hopes to achieve with it.

### Summary
* Businesses can pave the way to sustainability by aiming to make sustainable customer experiences a priority and reimagine impactful ways to get there. 
* Social responsibility on the business front must be prioritized to make an active effort to reduce multi-fold environmental consequences.
* The basics of sustainability reporting and materiality, examining the characteristics of good metrics and KPIs for sustainability reporting. 
* The different ways that companies build confidence in the accuracy of their sustainability reporting, by understanding the fundamentals of assurance.

## Impact of Digital and Analytics on Clean Technologies
### Pre-assessment
* **Artificial intelligence** applications can analyze data and take independent actions.
* **Autonomous vehicles traveling at steady speeds** will have the largest impact on fuel efficiency.
* **Visualization** is good to have, but it is not integral to analytical systems. Raw data, infrastructure, and algorithms are the core components of analytical systems.
* **Ensuring alignment with organizational goals**. When evaluating the commercial viability of machine learning and AI projects, ensuring they align with an organization's long-term objectives is paramount. 
* **Volume**. Data will grow in volume and velocity as IoT devices become more complex.

### Understanding the impact of digital and analytics on businesses
It is vital to move from predicting what may happen to using autonomous systems that can optimize situations in **real-time**.

Leading companies in the digital and analytics spaces are typically large e-commerce companies that focus on social media, finance, and search. Data is the core business process of these companies, commonly known as **data-first** companies, which is why they invest heavily in capturing, storing, analyzing, and using data.

Industries that **lag** in adopting digital and analytics are those where data is not the core business. These include the services, manufacturing, agriculture, and clean technology industries. 

Machine learning and artificial intelligence systems can be designed to adapt and adjust themselves as the data changes, which is beneficial in conditions that change constantly, such as weather and energy usage conditions. Clean technology companies are now poised to leverage many of these advances as data capture has become simpler.

Data-first industries have an advantage, as their customers interface with them electronically through an app, website, or other digital method.

#### IoT
By leveraging recent improvements in Internet of Things (IoT) technology, clean energy technology companies can capture and use granular physical data in two primary ways:
* IoT sensors can be placed throughout the energy ecosystem to track production and consumption in real-time; this data is then analyzed and used by both consumers and producers to modify supply and demand.
* IoT sensors can also be placed throughout the ecosystem to monitor real-time equipment performance to ensure highly efficient processes, maximum energy production, and predictive maintenance.

Data-first companies are already applying artificial intelligence and machine learning at a transactional level.

While digital and analytics applications previously provided insights into the past and forecasts of the future, they can now autonomously make decisions and take actions based on available data and advanced algorithms that enable automated systems to continuously learn and adapt.

### Technologies and Capabilities for Adopting Digital and Analytics Processes
Autonomous systems are critical in the successful adoption of clean technologies, as these systems are the only way clean technologies can scale effectively and adapt to rapidly and constantly changing conditions. 

#### The three main components required to develop analytics systems
* Raw data. Today’s Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can capture accurate and granular environmental data, such as light intensity, wind speed, humidity, motion, and acceleration.
* Infrastructure. Open-source data platforms can help store large data volumes at low cost. 
* Algorithms. Machine learning and artificial intelligence systems that enable clean technologies to become self-aware and self-managed with minimal human involvement or oversight.

#### The data generated by IoT devices will continuously grow in
* volume
* velocity

#### Methodology to develop autonomous systems
* Deep understanding of how processes work, what actions and decisions are needed, and what data is required to support them.

#### Skills needed to develop
* the ability to understand and analyze complex data
* the ability to transform both into a complex, integrated system

#### Stages in the digital and analytics life cycle
* understanding the past and the present
* predictions based on past, present, and future expectations using sophisticated statistical models
* developing autonomous systems that continuously learn, evolve, and ultimately become self-aware

#### The biggest challenge in developing autonomous systems
- predicting, planning, and designing for the many data exceptions that occur in a constantly changing physical world.

#### The implications of designing for the worst-case scenario are
* complex
* expensive
* time-consuming

It will take time, investment, and patience for digital and analytics systems to achieve their potential, but given the need and opportunity that they present, clean technology companies need to implement the technology and capabilities to leverage them.

### Improving clean technologies using digital and analytics
Clean technologies can benefit from digital and analytics techniques that can create autonomous, self-learning, and self-managed processes. Such processes can make clean technology more efficient and cost-effective.

Autonomous systems are the key to adopting clean technology and can be created through advanced digital and analytical techniques. With continuous monitoring and adapting to changing conditions using digital and analytics techniques, clean technologies can see vast improvements in cost, performance, and adoption

Due to dynamic conditions both in production and consumption, humans cannot make decisions instantaneously. Efficient, clean technology implementation requires machine learning and artificial intelligence. Complex algorithms, along with the data-sharing capabilities of neural networks, enable machine learning.

These algorithms use three methods for learning:
* **Reinforcement learning**: An algorithm generates options based on analyzed data, and once an option is selected, the algorithm is rewarded so that it can apply the same solution in similar situations. An intelligent thermostat asks a consumer if the temperature should be lowered if there has been no human activity for a period. Based on the answers, it can then adapt and act independently.
* **Supervised learning**: Programmers tell the machine the correct answer for a given situation so that the machine can store it for similar scenarios. A machine can be programmed to know that, in certain scenarios, it should automatically turn off the lights. It will then act independently when a similar situation arises.
* **Unsupervised or predictive learning**: The machine attempts to mimic how humans typically learn through observing the world and drawing conclusions. This type of learning is yet to be developed.

Clean technologies use reinforcement and supervised learning most often. 

### Knowledge Check
* **Exception data**. Machines and algorithms should pass on exceptions to humans for further investigation, as these may fall outside of their programmed capabilities.
* **Analyzing the past** is the first step in the digital and analytics life cycle. Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud are later steps in the digital and analytics life cycle.
* **By providing usage data**. By having detailed analytics on consumption, consumers can make intelligent decisions on energy usage based on the data.
* **These sensors enable maximum production and predictive maintenance**. Clean energy companies should use IoT sensors to capture equipment performance data because these sensors enable maximum production and predictive maintenance.
* **Financial data**. Business processes, actions and decisions, and required data must all be understood in detail to build an autonomous system. Financial data is not necessarily needed to build an autonomous system.

### Summary
* Digital and analytics techniques can be used to make decisions based on available data and advanced algorithms and can be used to not only automate inefficient legacy processes but also to create entirely new products and services.
* The adoption of digital and analytics technology is complex for clean technology companies where the underlying business processes are still evolving, the capabilities for data to be captured and analyzed are in the beginning stages, and the requirements for the algorithms are still unknown.
* Digital and analytics are at the core of the adoption of clean technologies. The data captured at a granular level, combined with increasingly sophisticated learning algorithms, enables the large-scale transformation of entire industries, making them more efficient, lowering their energy consumption, and increasing cost-effectiveness.

## Sustainable Technologies
### Pre-assessment
* **Adjusting the software development life cycle to be leaner and cleaner**. Green software encompasses multiple areas- starting with a revamped software development life cycle, green user experience, and management of data, to the way we use artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud, as well as the entire underlying IT infrastructure.
* **Sustainable technologies reduce technology's environmental impact and support broader sustainability efforts**. Sustainable technologies can help clients meet their sustainability goals and deliver significant business value by reducing the operational footprint of technology itself and enabling the broader business, stakeholders, and ecosystem to reduce their footprint. They do not necessarily help in increasing their product demand or in developing ethical guidelines for their business.
* **Measuring battery consumption during testing** is recommended to evaluate the environmental impacts of the software and align with sustainability goals. This approach helps identify areas where energy efficiency can be improved. 
* **To lower the digital carbon footprints**. Addressing sustainability in the digital sector, particularly in reducing the carbon footprint of smartphones and digital systems, is crucial for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The rapid growth in digital technology usage is contributing significantly to global carbon emissions, making it essential to find solutions to reduce this impact and combat climate change. 

### Understanding the Functionality of Sustainable Technologies
#### Deploying sustainable technologies 
##### Sustainable technologies
* sustainable cloud
* sustainable IT
* sustainable software

##### Sustainable technologies benefits for businesses
* cut energy costs
* minimize the carbon footprint
* advance other sustainability goals while spurring innovation and providing business value in the form of new products and services

#### Sustainable technology: Transformation levers
##### Three categories of transformation levers
* **New business models** make products, services, and the entire value network more sustainable. This can include circular products and services and cloud-driven accessibility. 
* **Corporate functions**. Empowered sustainability management can benefit corporate functions through transparent value chains and remote work capabilities.
* **IT organizations**. The IT departments manage data center environmental impact, migrate workloads, modernize apps, and dispose of equipment.

#### Sustainable cloud: How it works
The practical use of sustainable cloud, sustainable IT, and sustainable software, their outcomes and impacts, and the key factors businesses must consider when implementing these technologies. The underlying question is how business leaders should approach the cloud to achieve their sustainability goals. 

#### Sustainable IT: How It Works
Much of the potential inherent in the sustainable cloud derives from how to manage IT operations sustainably. The sustainable cloud helps reduce the IT organization's operational footprint through several levers, including but not limited to: 
* Increased reliance on renewable energy
* Reduced consumption of water to cool down infrastructure facilities
* Reduced electronic waste
* More responsible management of data and applications

This begins with the business leader defining strategic IT objectives and a guiding framework in the context of the organization’s broader corporate sustainability commitments. 
* Sustainable management of hardware can lead to reduced energy consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and waste from IT's global footprint.
* Opportunities for reducing the carbon footprint can be found by optimizing operational efficiency of facilities and on-premises infrastructure and in driving greater circularity and efficiency of end-user devices.

#### Sustainable software: How it works 
* The **computational power** needed to run large AI training models has been increasing exponentially, doubling every 3 to 4 months.  For example, it was found that a simple AI model to identify flowers increased model accuracy from 96 percent to 98 percent, resulting in a nearly seven-times jump in energy consumption. 
* **Data center optimization**. It is important to consider power-aware computing principles and optimize data centers in order to implement sustainable cloud server architectures like serverless computing and containerization. Containerization involves packaging software code to run consistently on any infrastructure.  Another approach is to deploy energy-efficient hardware at the edge (near the device or the end user), such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). 
* **Software delivery life cycle**. Every software decision must be viewed through a sustainability lens, including user interfaces, mobile application design, algorithms, data transfer techniques, network protocols, and ML models. A sustainable-first software delivery life cycle helps methodically navigate these complex decisions.

#### How does this work in practice?
##### Standard metrics for sustainability measurement
* power consumption
* carbon emissions
* at the testing stage, the battery consumption of end devices

It is also useful to focus on energy-efficient languages and frameworks for the software's most frequently used sections and evaluate quality from a sustainability perspective.

##### What trade-off to consider for an ML component:
* business goals 
* the desired model accuracy
* potential environmental impacts, such as increased energy usage for greater accuracy

#### Achieving superior sustainability outcomes
When combined in harmony, sustainable cloud, IT, and software allow organizations to drive better customer outcomes.
* **Improved accessibility to data and information**. Users and partners now have greater accessibility to documents, data, insights, presentations, and software solutions.
* **Improved products or services**. Faster or more secure delivery of life-critical products, such as telemedicine.
* **Circularity**. Greater circularity of hardware and servers that go into data centers.

##### Implementing sustainable cloud, IT, and software 
Several major corporations have implemented sustainable technologies to meet their sustainability targets and provide substantial business benefits to their customers and stakeholders. 

A large US-based global technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products, which became carbon neutral in 2007 and carbon net zero in 2020, has been focusing on shifting computing workloads toward data centers that rely on low-carbon sources of energy. The company also has a goal of sourcing renewable energy 24/7 and plans on investing heavily in onsite power generation and storage rather than relying on Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or carbon credits.

The e-Stewards initiative assigns global standards for e-waste recycling and refurbishment. 99% of e-waste is disposed of responsibly through e-Stewards certified Asset Disposition programs (ITAD).

### Achieving Sustainable Technology Milestones in Business
#### Maximizing sustainability impact with technology
Business priorities guide sustainability strategy, which is typically supported by targets around reducing carbon emissions, energy, or water consumption or gaining greater transparency in the supply chain. A strategic roadmap is valuable for tracking performance, using well-chosen Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). 

The global IT function can provide strategic support to meet sustainability commitments.

Not every business will be at the same maturity level regarding sustainable cloud, IT, and software. This also has to be factored into the ambition-setting process. The current maturity level and the organization’s long-term ambition must be understood.

Translating ambition to action requires understanding the business case and the desired impacts. Investing time in this step helps identify the initiatives that can deliver the desired sustainability outcomes.

#### Power of the cloud 
Cloud migrations, for example, can unlock new opportunities like clean energy transitions enabled by cloud-based geographic analyses, material waste reductions from better data insights, and targeted medical research and development (R&D) as a result of faster analytics platforms. Migrating to the public cloud can also better position companies to deliver on financial targets. 

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) savings can be as much as 30% to 40%. Drivers like greater workload flexibility, better server utilization rates, and more energy-efficient infrastructure make public clouds more cost-efficient than enterprise-owned data centers.

* Clean Energy Transitions
* Material Waste Reductions
* Targeted Medical R&D

### Sustainability Technology and Transformation Agenda
#### Implementation of the technology and transformation agenda 
Digitization is advancing rapidly, leading to increased pressure on businesses to embrace sustainable practices in cloud computing, IT, and software solutions. Organizations are adopting sustainable technologies to transform their business operations and achieve sustainability goals.

#### Sustainable cloud
Sustainable cloud refers to cloud computing services and infrastructure that are designed, operated, and maintained with a focus on minimizing their environmental impact and promoting sustainability.

##### Double-helix effect of sustainable cloud
The sustainable cloud can deliver a double-helix effect of shareholder and stakeholder value by simultaneously reducing costs and carbon emissions. As organizations move increasingly to the public cloud, the sustainable cloud makes it possible to lower carbon emissions and unlock new responsible cloud technology applications. 

##### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) migrations
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) migrations involve migrating applications from enterprise-owned to the cloud without major redesigns of applications or workflows. These basic cloud-first journeys pave the way for significant carbon reduction opportunities.

###### Main drivers of IaaS
* better power improvements
* cooling improvements

IaaS migrations can reduce carbon emissions by more than 84% compared with conventional infrastructure. Reductions can be pushed even higher by up to 98% by designing applications specifically for the cloud.

#### Sustainable IT 
At the center of the journey toward the sustainable IT technology and transformation agenda is the responsible use of technology and how technologies can help address critical challenges facing society and help build a more sustainable and inclusive world. This can include championing device and hardware circularity and management, applying cloud-first and optimizing the operational efficiency of on-premise infrastructure and data centers, and deploying green software and data management. 

##### Benefits of adopting sustainable IT
There are other ways tech can be a force for good: enabling access to finance, supply chain transparency, supporting remote collaboration, and minimizing travel and related carbon emissions. An important aspect is enabling responsible digital workers and business functions (i.e., next-generation solutions that allow people to work sustainably).

##### Leveraging the role of sustainable IT
An organization can broaden its influence by fully leveraging the role of sustainable technology. This can include essential governance principles such as setting environmental standards at the strategic CIO level and engaging stakeholders on sustainable technology practices and policies.

##### Adopting sustainable architecture 
Sustainable cloud, IT, and software solutions depend on sustainable architecture. Sustainable architecture refers to infrastructure designs that are environmentally responsible, energy-efficient, and aligned with the long-term sustainability goals of an organization.

* **Virtualization**
* **Containerization**
* **Data Compression**

#### Sustainable software 
The aim of sustainable software solutions is to pinpoint the smallest possible environmental impact of an application. Having insight into the pros and cons of various methods guides the development of software. 

##### Reducing carbon emissions in software development
Carbon emissions can be reduced at several points along the software development journey, from algorithms and programming languages to APIs and libraries. When conserving energy for hardware designs for mobile, car, and home controls, software compatibility can be tested to identify the most environmentally beneficial option. 

##### Deploying sustainable software solutions
Dynamic code analysis tracks real-time power consumption when software is being deployed. This data illuminates the gaps between different design options and their energy profiles. Several companies are developing solutions for power-aware and efficient systems.

A robust strategy for deploying sustainable software effectively requires metrics for tracking progress. These could take different forms: for software updates, it might be a metric around energy consumption between a new and older version of a software application. Metrics like memory-use efficiencies, the amount of data used, and floating-point (mathematical) operations per second can be helpful.

### Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)
PLM is a business strategy for managing a product's entire life cycle, from initial concept to market delivery, including maintenance and continuous improvement. The primary goal of PLM is to enable a company to efficiently manage its products through different life cycle stages, including introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. The following video provides more information on PLM. 

PLM fosters communication and collaboration both internally and with suppliers and customers. It also integrates people, processes, systems, and information.

PLM helps the company optimize its processes for sharing product information across the enterprise, from the design and development groups to manufacturing and procurement, to sales and marketing, collecting and organizing product documentation, planning for product environmental sustainability, analyzing product requirements, analyzing and selecting suppliers, and conducting cost-benefit analysis.

Generally speaking, PLM is more about how to produce a product than what is actually produced. 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for PLM lifecycle stages include an improved ability to hit key product milestones, meet sales goals, control costs, manage risks, stay within budget constraints, and meet quality metrics.

#### Four recommendations to senior management
1. PLM must become an executive-supported business strategy with a clear vision that is communicated company-wide and identifies performance gaps.
2. Rolling out PLM should be broken down into a series of related projects that addresses one process at a time, starting with calibrating each existing product's life cycle stage.
3. The focus should be on transforming and implementing new PLM processes and repairing broken ones without relying on an IT solution to solve the current problems. Training and pilot programs to achieve this outcome may be needed.
4. Knowledge should be captured together with lessons learned along the way. This knowledge can then be used for further process improvements and product innovation.

#### Basic concepts and issues of an impact assessment
Every good or service is only one element within a long chain of activities that begins with the extraction of resources and concludes with their disposal. When we acquire these goods or services, we are also implicitly choosing everything those activities depend upon and give rise to throughout the product lifecycle. An impact assessment evaluates the human and ecological effects of the resource, consumption, and emissions to the environment associated with the life cycle. 

### Green Software and Business Sustainability
#### Introduction to green software
##### Green software holistically considers the environmental impact of the entire Information Technology (IT) stack. 
* infrastructure comprising cloud and data centers 
* digital technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* blockchain (a digital, public ledger that records online transactions)

**Green software’s aim is to make such technologies less energy, hardware, and carbon intensive.**
* energy-efficient programming languages, frameworks, and coding patterns
* energy- and hardware-efficient system designs

##### Importance of Reducing energy consumption
Studies revealed that the energy requirements for maintaining the Bitcoin network exceeded that of the country of Switzerland.

Business plays a key role in advancing green technology. Integrating green software into a company’s overall sustainability strategy will help companies meet their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) targets, a top priority for investors and boards.

#### Sustainability a top priority for all stakeholders

#### Driving sustainability outcomes
By linking sustainability with digital technology for true transformation, companies can drive positive sustainability outcomes to the benefit of all their stakeholders. 

### Green Software and Business Strategies
#### Green software principles in practice 
To put green software principles into practice and achieve their sustainable technology ambitions, companies do well when they follow a **four-phased approach**. This approach covers all **seven areas of green software**: 
* the software development life cycle
* the user's digital experience
* the cloud
* edge (computing done at or near the source of data) and data centers 
* data 
* digital ledger technology
* artificial intelligence and IT infrastructure

#####  The four-phased approach involves:
 The four-phased approach involves:
1. **Analysis**: Analyze the existing IT organization across all seven areas to baseline emissions and benchmark the organization's sustainability maturity.
2. **Strategy**: Strategize areas of improvement using different decarbonization levers. Assess the impact of those levers and create a capability road map and action plan.
3. **Implementation**: Implement these strategic priorities throughout the organization.
4. **Optimization**: Continuously optimize sustainability improvements.

### Green Software and Business Performance
#### Green So0ftware Adoption
Green software involves adopting environmentally friendly practices and technologies in IT, reducing energy consumption, minimizing electronic waste, and promoting sustainability. It enhances operational efficiency, competitiveness, and profitability while contributing to a healthier planet.

Green software is a powerful way to combine technology and sustainability, enabling companies to advance both their own **carbon reduction goals** and **the net-zero emissions economy**.

An organization that has integrated the principles of green software can witness radical transformation with far-reaching benefits.

By using green software, organizations tap into new areas of innovation and often achieve overall stronger business performance.

### Knowledge Check

For organizations to transform successfully to a green software mindset, it is important they consider three areas: green IT infrastructure, green cloud, and green software. An organization that has integrated the principles of green software can witness radical transformation, with far-reaching benefits.
* **Reduced carbon emissions**. In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), applications are migrated from enterprise-owned servers to the cloud. The key benefit is over 84% reduction in carbon emissions. This is driven by better power and cooling improvements that allow for less energy per compute unit, newer and more efficient hardware optimized by cloud providers, and server utilization rates many times greater than typical enterprise-owned rates. 
* **Setting the right environmental goals and changing the organizational mindset**. While online tools can assist with developing more energy-efficient green software and IT systems, there are two key steps for an organization to achieve a green software transformation: setting the right environmental goals and changing the organizational mindset. Enabling superior disaster recovery and enhancing digital security, although positive actions, are not key to achieving a green software transformation.
* **Change electronic devices every year**. Every member of society can contribute to reducing the impact of digital technology. A good practice is to delete unwanted files periodically from cloud storage. Other effective actions include lowering device brightness, limiting unnecessary emails, and reducing electronic waste by extending device life through repair or refurbishment.
