    ">\n",
    "> * Expand the *Outline* panel from the bottom left corner of the IDE to expose a table of contents for the instructions in this notebook. The panel can be resized as well. You can use the task heading links to navigate if it is helpful.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * If at any point your reload this browser tab, you want to continue where you left off previously in the notebook, you may need to again run all code blocks that you ran previously in order for the later code blocks to have access to the output of the earlier code blocks. This can be essential to the functioning of the code. For example, if \"import boto3\" appears in an early code cell it may still be a dependency in a later code cell. Keep this in mind as a possible cause if or when you encounter errors.\n",

      "\n",
      "* 4 cups stale bread, cut into 1-inch cubes (any type of bread works, but Challah or brioche is ideal)\n",
      "* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n",
      "* 1/2 cup brown sugar\n",
      "* 1/2 cup heavy cream\n",
      "* 1/2 cup whole milk\n",
      "* 2 large eggs\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n",
      "* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n",
      "* Raisins or dried cranberries (optional)\n",

      "Instructions:\n",

      "1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).\n",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and melted butter until well combined.\n",
      "3. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking until smooth after each addition.\n",
      "4. Whisk in the heavy cream, whole milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt until well combined.\n",
      "5. Add the bread cubes to the mixture and toss until the bread is evenly coated.\n",
      "6. Pour the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and let it sit for 10-15 minutes to allow the bread to absorb the liquid.\n",
      "7. If using, sprinkle raisins or dried cranberries on top of the bread mixture.\n",
      "8. Bake the pudding for 35-40 minutes or until it's golden brown and set. You can check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the pudding; it should come out clean.\n",
      "9. Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool for 10-15 minutes.\n",
      "10. Serve warm, topped with your favorite whipped cream, caramel sauce, or powdered sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips and Variations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use a variety of breads, such as croissants or baguette, for a different flavor profile.\n",
      "* Add nuts (walnuts or pecans work well), chocolate chips, or dried fruit to the mixture for added texture and flavor.\n",
      "* Soak the raisins or cranberries in a liquor of your choice (such as bourbon or rum) for an adult twist.\n",
      "* Make individual servings in ramekins or mini cast-iron skillets for a fun presentation.\n",
